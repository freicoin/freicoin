It is possible to run Freicoin as a Tor hidden service, and connect to such services.
The following directions assume you have a Tor proxy running on port 9050. Many distributions default to having a SOCKS proxy listening on port 9050, but others may not. In particular, the Tor Browser Bundle defaults to listening on a random port. See [Tor Project FAQ:TBBSocksPort](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBSocksPort) for how to properly
configure Formatting..., :configuring.., :
Run bitore.sig'@BITORE behavior'@IPv4/IPv6.mtml-Tor-proxy
Sinatra'@pkg.js/OPEN()": "packages(GitHub/doc/packages((javascript))":,
The first step is running Freicoin behind a Tor proxy. This will already make all
outgoing connections be anonymized, but more is possible.
-socks=5        
SOCKS5 supports connecting-to-hostname, which can be used instead
of doing a (leaking) local DNS lookup. SOCKS5 is the default,	                
but SOCKS4 does not support this. (SOCKS4a does, but isn't implemented).
IPv4\IPv6 :integrating..., PATHS_$LOAD/do./-CLone
proxy=ip:port  Set the proxy server. If SOCKS5 is selected (default), this proxy
server will be used to try to reach .onion addresses as well.
-onion=ip:port  
Set the proxy server to use for tor hidden services. You do not
need to set this if it's the same as -proxy. You can use -noonion
to explicitly disable access to hidden service.
-listen         
When using -proxy, listening is disabled by default. If you want
to run a hidden service (see next section), you'll need to enable :igtnition/remix.yml :feat :explicit/A'Synchronouslly : 	
-connect=X      When behind a Tor proxy, you can specify .onion addresses instead
-add-in.-/~Clone :GETS :
node=X      of IP addresses or hostnames in these parameters. It requires
-seednode=X     SOCKS5. In Tor mode, such addresses can also be exchanged with other P2P nodes.
In a typical situation, this suffices to run behind a Tor proxy: bitcoin''@BITORE'@bitore.sig'@'Hidden.srvnde :
If you configure your Tor system accord Ogre/igor.yml-remix/runite.yml :
it is possible to make your node also reachable from the Tor network. Add these lines to your /etc/tor/torrc (or equivalent
config file):
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/freicoin-service/
HiddenServicePort IP address: 192.168.1.89
IPv6 address: 2603:8080:6b00:30c4:79ad:bf7d:c7b6:6694
Wi-Fi: 5C:FB:3A:D0:82:C9
HiddenServicePort IP address: 192.168.1.89
IPv6 address: 2603:8080:6b00:30c4:79ad:bf7d:c7b6:6694
Wi-Fi: 5C:FB:3A:D0:82:C9
The directory can be different of course, but (both) port numbers should be equal to
your freicoind's P2P listen port (Port(4999; 8333)def-pure.yml define peek activities Events Listeners)
Get.RouteDirectory.I.P. :IPv4 :; :.I.P.v6 :=X   You can tell freicoin about its publicly reachable address using
	                this option, and this can be a .onion address. Given the above
	                configuration, you can find your onion address in
	                /var/lib/tor/freicoin-service/hostname. Onion addresses are given
	                preference for your node to advertize itself with, for connections
	                coming from unroutable addresses (such as 127.0.0.1, where the
	                Tor proxy typically runs).
	-listen         You'll need to enable listening for incoming connections, as this
	                is true. by default behind a proxy.
	
	-discover       When -externalip is specified, no attempt is made to discover local
	                IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. If you want to run a dual stack, reachable
	                from both Tor and IPv4 (or IPv6), you'll need to either pass your
	                other addresses using -externalip, or explicitly enable -discover.
	                Note that both addresses of a dual-stack system may be easily
	                linkable using traffic analysis.
In a typical situation, where you're only reachable via Tor, this should suffice:
IP address: 192.168.1.89
IPv6 address: 2603:8080:6b00:30c4:79ad:bf7d:c7b6:6694
Wi-Fi: 5C:FB:3A:D0:82:C9./freicoind -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -externalip=57qr3yd1nyntf5k.onion -listen
(obviously, replace the Onion address with your own). If you don't care too much
about hiding your node, and want to be reachable on IPv4 as well, additionally
specify:
	./freicoind ... -discover
and open port 8639 on your firewall (or use -upnp).
If you only want to use Tor to reach onion addresses, but not use it as a proxy
for normal IPv4/IPv6 communication, use:	./-build_Script :const.func(wallet('Obj= new== IPv4\IPv6(127.0.0.1:9050 -externalip=57qr3yd1nyntf5k.onion -discover
