# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,
# and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when there is a push to the "master" branch.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
#
# 1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.
#    For example: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region us-east-2`.
#    Replace the value of the `ECR_REPOSITORY` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's name.
#    Replace the value of the `AWS_REGION` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's region.
#
# 2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service.
#    For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console:
#      https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun
#    Replace the value of the `ECS_SERVICE` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the Amazon ECS service.
#    Replace the value of the `ECS_CLUSTER` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the cluster.
#
# 3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.
#    The format should follow the output of `aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton`.
#    Replace the value of the `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION` environment variable in the workflow below with the path to the JSON file.
#    Replace the value of the `CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable in the workflow below with the name of the container
#    in the `containerDefinitions` section of the task definition.
#
# 4. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
#    See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user,
#    and best practices on handling the access key credentials.

Manually running a workflow
To manually run a workflow, you can configure your workflow to use the workflow_dispatch event. This enables a "Run workflow" button on the Actions tab.

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
For more information, see "Manually running a workflow."

Running your jobs on different operating systems
GitHub Actions provides hosted runners for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

To set the operating system for your job, specify the operating system using runs-on:

jobs:
  my_job:
    name: deploy to staging
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
The available virtual machine types are:

ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-18.04, or ubuntu-16.04
windows-latest or windows-2019
macos-latest or macos-10.15
For more information, see "Virtual environments for GitHub Actions."

Using an action
Actions are reusable units of code that can be built and distributed by anyone on GitHub. You can find a variety of actions in GitHub Marketplace, and also in the official Actions repository.

To use an action, you must specify the repository that contains the action. We also recommend that you specify a Git tag to ensure you are using a released version of the action.

- name: Setup Node
  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
  with:
    node-version: '10.x'
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Running a command
You can run commands on the job's virtual machine.

- name: Install Dependencies
  run: npm install
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."
Running a job across a matrix of operating systems and runtime versions
You can automatically run a job across a set of different values, such as different versions of code libraries or operating systems.
For example, this job uses a matrix strategy to run across 3 versions of Node and 3 operating systems
jobs:
  test:
    name: Test on node ${{ matrix.node_version }} and ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node_version: ['8', '10', '12']
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node_version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node_version }}

    - name: npm install, build and test
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build --if-present
        npm test
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Running steps or jobs conditionally
GitHub Actions supports conditions on steps and jobs using data present in your workflow context.

For example, to run a step only as part of a push and not in a pull_request, you can specify a condition in the if: property based on the event name:

steps:
- run: npm publish
  if: github.event_name == 'push'
For more information, see "Contexts and expression syntax for GitHub Actions."
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
- name: Setup Node.js environment
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3.6.0

    # Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec.
    check-latest: # optional
    # Optional registry to set up for auth. Will set the registry in a project level .npmrc and .yarnrc file, and set up auth to read in from env.NODE_AUTH_TOKEN.

    # Used to pull node distributions from node-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.
    token: # optional, default is ${{ github.server_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token || '' }}
    # Used to specify a package manager for caching in the default directory. Supported values: npm, yarn, pnpm.

    # Used to specify the path to a dependency file: package-lock.json, yarn.lock, etc. Supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.
