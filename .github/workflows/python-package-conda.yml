AcceptHandshake
PDF
Sends a response to the originator of a handshake agreeing to the action proposed by the handshake request.

You can only call this operation by the following principals when they also have the relevant IAM permissions:

Invitation to join or Approve all features request handshakes: only a principal from the member account.

The user who calls the API for an invitation to join must have the organizations:AcceptHandshake permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, the user must also have the iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission so that AWS Organizations can create the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

Enable all features final confirmation handshake: only a principal from the management account.

For more information about invitations, see Inviting an AWS account to join your organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide. For more information about requests to enable all features in the organization, see Enabling all features in your organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

After you accept a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it's deleted.

Request Syntax
{
   "HandshakeId": "string"
}
Request Parameters
For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see Common Parameters.

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

HandshakeId

The regex pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 34.

Pattern: ^h-[0-9a-z]{8,32}$

Required: Yes

Handshake
A structure that contains details about the accepted handshake.

Type: Handshake object

Errors
For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see Common Errors.

AccessDeniedException
You don't have permissions to perform the requested operation. The user or role that is making the request must have at least one IAM permissions policy attached that grants the required permissions. For more information, see Access Management in the IAM User Guide.

HTTP Status Code: 400

AccessDeniedForDependencyException
The operation that you attempted requires you to have the iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole for organizations.amazonaws.com permission so that AWS Organizations can create the required service-linked role. You don't have that permission.

HTTP Status Code: 400

AWSOrganizationsNotInUseException
Your account isn't a member of an organization. To make this request, you must use the credentials of an account that belongs to an organization.

HTTP Status Code: 400

ConcurrentModificationException
The target of the operation is currently being modified by a different request. Try again later.

HTTP Status Code: 400

HandshakeAlreadyInStateException
The specified handshake is already in the requested state. For example, you can't accept a handshake that was already accepted.

HTTP Status Code: 400

HandshakeConstraintViolationException
The requested operation would violate the constraint identified in the reason code.

Note
Some of the reasons in the following list might not be applicable to this specific API or operation:

ACCOUNT_NUMBER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the limit on the number of accounts in an organization. Note that deleted and closed accounts still count toward your limit.

Important
If you get this exception immediately after creating the organization, wait one hour and try again. If after an hour it continues to fail with this error, contact AWS Support.

ALREADY_IN_AN_ORGANIZATION: The handshake request is invalid because the invited account is already a member of an organization.

HANDSHAKE_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the number of handshakes that you can send in one day.

INVITE_DISABLED_DURING_ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES: You can't issue new invitations to join an organization while it's in the process of enabling all features. You can resume inviting accounts after you finalize the process when all accounts have agreed to the change.

ORGANIZATION_ALREADY_HAS_ALL_FEATURES: The handshake request is invalid because the organization has already enabled all features.

ORGANIZATION_IS_ALREADY_PENDING_ALL_FEATURES_MIGRATION: The handshake request is invalid because the organization has already started the process to enable all features.

ORGANIZATION_FROM_DIFFERENT_SELLER_OF_RECORD: The request failed because the account is from a different marketplace than the accounts in the organization. For example, accounts with India addresses must be associated with the AISPL marketplace. All accounts in an organization must be from the same marketplace.

ORGANIZATION_MEMBERSHIP_CHANGE_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to change the membership of an account too quickly after its previous change.

PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT_REQUIRED: You can't complete the operation with an account that doesn't have a payment instrument, such as a credit card, associated with it.

HTTP Status Code: 400

HandshakeNotFoundException
We can't find a handshake with the HandshakeId that you specified.

HTTP Status Code: 400

InvalidHandshakeTransitionException
You can't perform the operation on the handshake in its current state. For example, you can't cancel a handshake that was already accepted or accept a handshake that was already declined.

HTTP Status Code: 400

InvalidInputException
The requested operation failed because you provided invalid values for one or more of the request parameters. This exception includes a reason that contains additional information about the violated limit:

Note
Some of the reasons in the following list might not be applicable to this specific API or operation.

DUPLICATE_TAG_KEY: Tag keys must be unique among the tags attached to the same entity.

IMMUTABLE_POLICY: You specified a policy that is managed by AWS and can't be modified.

INPUT_REQUIRED: You must include a value for all required parameters.

INVALID_EMAIL_ADDRESS_TARGET: You specified an invalid email address for the invited account owner.

INVALID_ENUM: You specified an invalid value.

INVALID_ENUM_POLICY_TYPE: You specified an invalid policy type string.

INVALID_FULL_NAME_TARGET: You specified a full name that contains invalid characters.

INVALID_LIST_MEMBER: You provided a list to a parameter that contains at least one invalid value.

INVALID_PAGINATION_TOKEN: Get the value for the NextToken parameter from the response to a previous call of the operation.

INVALID_PARTY_TYPE_TARGET: You specified the wrong type of entity (account, organization, or email) as a party.

INVALID_PATTERN: You provided a value that doesn't match the required pattern.

INVALID_PATTERN_TARGET_ID: You specified a policy target ID that doesn't match the required pattern.

INVALID_ROLE_NAME: You provided a role name that isn't valid. A role name can't begin with the reserved prefix AWSServiceRoleFor.

INVALID_SYNTAX_ORGANIZATION_ARN: You specified an invalid Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the organization.

INVALID_SYNTAX_POLICY_ID: You specified an invalid policy ID.

INVALID_SYSTEM_TAGS_PARAMETER: You specified a tag key that is a system tag. You can’t add, edit, or delete system tag keys because they're reserved for AWS use. System tags don’t count against your tags per resource limit.

MAX_FILTER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You can specify only one filter parameter for the operation.

MAX_LENGTH_EXCEEDED: You provided a string parameter that is longer than allowed.

MAX_VALUE_EXCEEDED: You provided a numeric parameter that has a larger value than allowed.

MIN_LENGTH_EXCEEDED: You provided a string parameter that is shorter than allowed.

MIN_VALUE_EXCEEDED: You provided a numeric parameter that has a smaller value than allowed.

MOVING_ACCOUNT_BETWEEN_DIFFERENT_ROOTS: You can move an account only between entities in the same root.

TARGET_NOT_SUPPORTED: You can't perform the specified operation on that target entity.

UNRECOGNIZED_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL: You specified a service principal that isn't recognized.

HTTP Status Code: 400

ServiceException
AWS Organizations can't complete your request because of an internal service error. Try again later.

HTTP Status Code: 400

TooManyRequestsException
You have sent too many requests in too short a period of time. The quota helps protect against denial-of-service attacks. Try again later.

For information about quotas that affect AWS Organizations, see Quotas for AWS Organizationsin the AWS Organizations User Guide.

HTTP Status Code: 400

Examples
Example
Diego, the owner of an organization, has previously invited Juan's account to join his organization. The following example shows Juan's account accepting the handshake and thus agreeing to the invitation.
