Python 3.11.1
Release Date: Dec. 6, 2022

Python 3.11 release logo

This is the first maintenance release of Python 3.11
Python 3.11.1 is the newest major release of the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and optimizations.

Major new features of the 3.11 series, compared to 3.10
Some of the new major new features and changes in Python 3.11 are:

General changes
PEP 657 -- Include Fine-Grained Error Locations in Tracebacks
PEP 654 -- Exception Groups and except*
PEP 680 -- tomllib: Support for Parsing TOML in the Standard Library
gh-90908 -- Introduce task groups to asyncio
gh-34627 -- Atomic grouping ((?>...)) and possessive quantifiers (*+, ++, ?+, {m,n}+) are now supported in regular expressions.
The Faster CPython Project is already yielding some exciting results. Python 3.11 is up to 10-60% faster than Python 3.10. On average, we measured a 1.22x speedup on the standard benchmark suite. See Faster CPython for details.
Typing and typing language changes
PEP 673 -- Self Type
PEP 646 -- Variadic Generics
PEP 675 -- Arbitrary Literal String Type
PEP 655 -- Marking individual TypedDict items as required or potentially-missing
PEP 681 -- Data Class Transforms

And now for something completely different
Quark–gluon plasma (QGP) or quark soup is an interacting localized assembly of quarks and gluons at thermal and chemical equilibrium. The word plasma signals that free colour charges are allowed. In a 1987 summary, Léon van Hove pointed out the equivalence of the three terms: quark-gluon plasma, quark matter and a new state of matter. Since the temperature is above the Hagedorn temperature—and thus above the scale of light u,d-quark mass—the pressure exhibits the relativistic Stefan-Boltzmann format governed by temperature to the fourth power (T^4) and many practically massless quark and gluon constituents. It can be said that QGP emerges to be the new phase of strongly interacting matter which manifests its physical properties in terms of nearly free dynamics of practically massless gluons and quarks. Both quarks and gluons must be present in conditions near chemical equilibrium with their colour charge open for a new state of matter to be referred to as QGP.

In the Big Bang theory, quark–gluon plasma filled the entire Universe before matter as we know it was created. Theories predicting the existence of quark–gluon plasma were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Discussions around heavy ion experimentation followed suit and the first experiment proposals were put forward at CERN and BNL in the following years. Quark–gluon plasma was detected for the first time in the laboratory at CERN in the year 2000.

:sparkle: View the [official GitHub public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247)[^1]

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [GitHub public feedback discussions](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions). 

[^1]:We've adopted the latest [beta features of GitHub projects](https://github.com/features/issues) for the [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247). The [roadmap project board](https://github.com/github/roadmap/projects/1) within this repository is now closed. 

The roadmap repository is for communicating GitHub’s roadmap. Existing issues are currently read-only, and we are locking conversations, as we get started. Interaction limits are also in place to ensure issues originate from GitHub. We’re planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself, and we see potential to engage more in discussions about the future of GitHub products and features. If you have feedback about this roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through [general feedback in GitHub public feedback discussions](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/new?category=General-Feedback&title=[Public%20roadmap]%20).

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:
- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases. 
- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas,see below.
- A **feature** that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs. For a list of current features, see below. 
- One or more **product SKU** labels that indicate which product SKUs we expect the feature to be available in. For a list of current product SKUs, see below.
- One or more **deployment models** (cloud, server, and/or ae). Where not stated, features will generally come out Cloud first, and follow on Server and GHAE at or soon after GA.
- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant [Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) post.
## Release phases
Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.
- **alpha:** *Primarily for testing and feedback*\
Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs or support provided.
- **beta:** *Publicly available in full or limited capacity*\
Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.
- **ga:** *Generally available to all customers*\
Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations. Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.
Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows: 
- **in design:**
Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.
- **exploring:**\
Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.
#Release phases - For GHES
Some features may be marked with a GHES 3.X label, which indicates that the feature will also become available for Github Enterprise Server customers. Below are the release version numbers and expected release quarters (_Note: these dates are subject to change_). 
**GHES release version dates**:
| **Version Number** | **Release Quarter** | **Release Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| 3.5 | Q2 2022 | [Release Notes](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.5/admin/release-notes) |
| 3.6 | Q3 2022 | [Release Notes](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/admin/release-notes) |
| 3.7 | Q4 2022 | - |
| 3.8 | Q1 2023 | - |
## Roadmap stages
The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.  You'll also find an **Exploratory** column, which is used in conjunction with the **in design** and **exploring** release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.
GitHub Enterprise Server has major releases on a quarterly bass, and minor releases on a monthly basis. Once we know what version we are delivering a feature, we will update the issue to indicate that information.
