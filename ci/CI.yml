System Locale and Keyboard Configuration\nThe system locale specifies the language settings of system services and user interfaces. The keyboard layout settings control the layout used on the text console and graphical user interfaces.\n\nThese settings can be made by modifying the /etc/locale.conf configuration file or by using the localectl utility. Also, you can use the graphical user interface to perform the task; for a description of this method, see Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide.\n\n2.1. Setting the System Locale\nSystem-wide locale settings are stored in the /etc/locale.conf file, which is read at early boot by the systemd daemon. The locale settings configured in /etc/locale.conf are inherited by every service or user, unless individual programs or individual users override them.\n\nThe basic file format of /etc/locale.conf is a newline-separated list of variable assignments. For example, German locale with English messages in /etc/locale.conf looks as follows:\n\nLANG=de_DE.UTF-8\nLC_MESSAGES=C\nHere, the LC_MESSAGES option determines the locale used for diagnostic messages written to the standard error output. To further specify locale settings in /etc/locale.conf, you can use several other options, the most relevant are summarized in Table 2.1, “Options configurable in /etc/locale.conf”. See the locale(7) manual page for detailed information on these options. Note that the LC_ALL option, which represents all possible options, should not be configured in /etc/locale.conf.\n\nTable 2.1. Options configurable in /etc/locale.conf\n\n\nOption        Description\nLANG\n\nProvides a default value for the system locale.\n\nLC_COLLATE\n\nChanges the behavior of functions which compare strings in the local alphabet.\n\nLC_CTYPE\n\nChanges the behavior of the character handling and classification functions and the multibyte character functions.\n\nLC_NUMERIC\n\nDescribes the way numbers are usually printed, with details such as decimal point versus decimal comma.\n\nLC_TIME\n\nChanges the display of the current time, 24-hour versus 12-hour clock.\n\nLC_MESSAGES\n\nDetermines the locale used for diagnostic messages written to the standard error output.\n\n2.1.1. Displaying the Current Status\nThe localectl command can be used to query and change the system locale and keyboard layout settings. To show the current settings, use the status option:\n\nlocalectl status\nExample 2.1. Displaying the Current Status\n\nThe output of the previous command lists the currently set locale, keyboard layout configured for the console and for the X11 window system.\n\n~]$ localectl status\n  System Locale: LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n    VC Keymap: us\n   X11 Layout: n/a\n2.1.2. Listing Available Locales\nTo list all locales available for your system, type:\n\nlocalectl list-locales\nExample 2.2. Listing Locales\n\nImagine you want to select a specific English locale, but you are not sure if it is available on the system. You can check that by listing all English locales with the following command:\n\n~]$ localectl list-locales | grep en_\nen_AG\nen_AG.utf8\nen_AU\nen_AU.iso88591\nen_AU.utf8\nen_BW\nen_BW.iso88591\nen_BW.utf8\n\noutput truncated\n2.1.3. Setting the Locale\nTo set the default system locale, use the following command as root:\n\nlocalectl set-locale LANG=locale\nReplace locale with the locale name, found with the localectl list-locales command. The above syntax can also be used to configure parameters from Table 2.1, “Options configurable in /etc/locale.conf”.\n\nExample 2.3. Changing the Default Locale\n\nFor example, if you want to set British English as your default locale, first find the name of this locale by using list-locales. Then, as root, type the command in the following form:\n\n~]# localectl set-locale LANG=en_GB.utf8\n2.1.4. Making System Locale Settings Permanent when Installing with Kickstart\nWhen Red Hat Enterprise Linux is installed with the Red Hat Kickstart installation method, setting of the system locales might not be persistent after an upgrade of the operating system.\n\nWhen the %packages section of the Kickstart file includes the --instLang option, the _install_langs RPM macro is set to the particular value for this installation, and the set of installed locales is adjusted accordingly. However, this adjustment affects only this installation, not subsequent upgrades. If an upgrade reinstalls the glibc package, the entire set of locales is upgraded instead of only the locales you requested during the installation.\n\nTo avoid this, make the choice of locales permanent. You have these options:\n\nIf you have not started the Kickstart installation, modify the Kickstart file to include instructions for setting RPM macros globally by applying this procedure: Setting RPM macros during the Kickstart installation\nIf you have already installed the system, set RPM macros globally on the system by applying this procedure: Setting RPM macros globally\nSetting RPM macros during the Kickstart installation\n\nModify the %post section of the Kickstart file:\n\nLANG=en_US\necho \"%_install_langs $LANG\" > /etc/rpm/macros.language-conf\n\nyum-config-manager --setopt=override_install_langs=$LANG --save\nModify the %packages section of the Kickstart file:\n\n%packages\nyum-utils*\n%end\nSetting RPM macros globally\n\nCreate the RPM configuration file at /etc/rpm/macros.language-conf with the following contents:\n\n%_install_langs LANG\nLANG is the value of the instLang option.\n\nUpdate the /etc/yum.conf file with:\n\noverride_install_langs=LANG\n2.2. Changing the Keyboard Layout\nThe keyboard layout settings enable the user to control the layout used on the text console and graphical user interfaces.\n\n2.2.1. Displaying the Current Settings\nAs mentioned before, you can check your current keyboard layout configuration with the following command:\n\nlocalectl status\nExample 2.4. Displaying the Keyboard Settings\n\nIn the following output, you can see the keyboard layout configured for the virtual console and for the X11 window system.\n\n~]$ localectl status\n  System Locale: LANG=en_US.utf8\n    VC Keymap: us\n   X11 Layout: us\n2.2.2. Listing Available Keymaps\nTo list all available keyboard layouts that can be configured on your system, type:\n\nlocalectl list-keymaps\nExample 2.5. Searching for a Particular Keymap\n\nYou can use grep to search the output of the previous command for a specific keymap name. There are often multiple keymaps compa\nCharacters remaining: 0\nPayment Request Agreement \nPlease read this statement and indicate your agreement by checking the \"I have read...\" box.

System Locale and Keyboard Configuration\nThe system locale specifies the language settings of system services and user interfaces. The keyboard layout settings control the layout used on the text console and graphical user interfaces.\n\nThese settings can be made by modifying the /etc/locale.conf configuration file or by using the localectl utility. Also, you can use the graphical user interface to perform the task; for a description of this method, see Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide.\n\n2.1. Setting the System Locale\nSystem-wide locale settings are stored in the /etc/locale.conf file, which is read at early boot by the systemd daemon. The locale settings configured in /etc/locale.conf are inherited by every service or user, unless individual programs or individual users override them.\n\nThe basic file format of /etc/locale.conf is a newline-separated list of variable assignments. For example, German locale with English messages in /etc/locale.conf looks as follows:\n\nLANG=de_DE.UTF-8\nLC_MESSAGES=C\nHere, the LC_MESSAGES option determines the locale used for diagnostic messages written to the standard error output. To further specify locale settings in /etc/locale.conf, you can use several other options, the most relevant are summarized in Table 2.1, “Options configurable in /etc/locale.conf”. See the locale(7) manual page for detailed information on these options. Note that the LC_ALL option, which represents all possible options, should not be configured in /etc/locale.conf.\n\nTable 2.1. Options configurable in /etc/locale.conf\n\n\nOption        Description\nLANG\n\nProvides a default value for the system locale.\n\nLC_COLLATE\n\nChanges the behavior of functions which compare strings in the local alphabet.\n\nLC_CTYPE\n\nChanges the behavior of the character handling and classification functions and the multibyte character functions.\n\nLC_NUMERIC\n\nDescribes the way numbers are usually printed, with details such as decimal point versus decimal comma.\n\nLC_TIME\n\nChanges the display of the current time, 24-hour versus 12-hour clock.\n\nLC_MESSAGES\n\nDetermines the locale used for diagnostic messages written to the standard error output.\n\n2.1.1. Displaying the Current Status\nThe localectl command can be used to query and change the system locale and keyboard layout settings. To show the current settings, use the status option:\n\nlocalectl status\nExample 2.1. Displaying the Current Status\n\nThe output of the previous command lists the currently set locale, keyboard layout configured for the console and for the X11 window system.\n\n~]$ localectl status\n  System Locale: LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n    VC Keymap: us\n   X11 Layout: n/a\n2.1.2. Listing Available Locales\nTo list all locales available for your system, type:\n\nlocalectl list-locales\nExample 2.2. Listing Locales\n\nImagine you want to select a specific English locale, but you are not sure if it is available on the system. You can check that by listing all English locales with the following command:\n\n~]$ localectl list-locales | grep en_\nen_AG\nen_AG.utf8\nen_AU\nen_AU.iso88591\nen_AU.utf8\nen_BW\nen_BW.iso88591\nen_BW.utf8\n\noutput truncated\n2.1.3. Setting the Locale\nTo set the default system locale, use the following command as root:\n\nlocalectl set-locale LANG=locale\nReplace locale with the locale name, found with the localectl list-locales command. The above syntax can also be used to configure parameters from Table 2.1, “Options configurable in /etc/locale.conf”.\n\nExample 2.3. Changing the Default Locale\n\nFor example, if you want to set British English as your default locale, first find the name of this locale by using list-locales. Then, as root, type the command in the following form:\n\n~]# localectl set-locale LANG=en_GB.utf8\n2.1.4. Making System Locale Settings Permanent when Installing with Kickstart\nWhen Red Hat Enterprise Linux is installed with the Red Hat Kickstart installation method, setting of the system locales might not be persistent after an upgrade of the operating system.\n\nWhen the %packages section of the Kickstart file includes the --instLang option, the _install_langs RPM macro is set to the particular value for this installation, and the set of installed locales is adjusted accordingly. However, this adjustment affects only this installation, not subsequent upgrades. If an upgrade reinstalls the glibc package, the entire set of locales is upgraded instead of only the locales you requested during the installation.\n\nTo avoid this, make the choice of locales permanent. You have these options:\n\nIf you have not started the Kickstart installation, modify the Kickstart file to include instructions for setting RPM macros globally by applying this procedure: Setting RPM macros during the Kickstart installation\nIf you have already installed the system, set RPM macros globally on the system by applying this procedure: Setting RPM macros globally\nSetting RPM macros during the Kickstart installation\n\nModify the %post section of the Kickstart file:\n\nLANG=en_US\necho \"%_install_langs $LANG\" > /etc/rpm/macros.language-conf\n\nyum-config-manager --setopt=override_install_langs=$LANG --save\nModify the %packages section of the Kickstart file:\n\n%packages\nyum-utils*\n%end\nSetting RPM macros globally\n\nCreate the RPM configuration file at /etc/rpm/macros.language-conf with the following contents:\n\n%_install_langs LANG\nLANG is the value of the instLang option.\n\nUpdate the /etc/yum.conf file with:\n\noverride_install_langs=LANG\n2.2. Changing the Keyboard Layout\nThe keyboard layout settings enable the user to control the layout used on the text console and graphical user interfaces.\n\n2.2.1. Displaying the Current Settings\nAs mentioned before, you can check your current keyboard layout configuration with the following command:\n\nlocalectl status\nExample 2.4. Displaying the Keyboard Settings\n\nIn the following output, you can see the keyboard layout configured for the virtual console and for the X11 window system.\n\n~]$ localectl status\n  System Locale: LANG=en_US.utf8\n    VC Keymap: us\n   X11 Layout: us\n2.2.2. Listing Available Keymaps\nTo list all available keyboard layouts that can be configured on your system, type:\n\nlocalectl list-keymaps\nExample 2.5. Searching for a Particular Keymap\n\nYou can use grep to search the output of the previous command for a specific keymap name. There are often multiple keymaps compa\nCharacters remaining: 0\nPayment Request Agreement \nPlease read this statement and indicate your agreement by checking the \"I have read...\" box.

System Locale and Keyboard Configuration\nThe system locale specifies the language settings of system services and user interfaces. The keyboard layout settings control the layout used on the text console and graphical user interfaces.\n\nThese settings can be made by modifying the /etc/locale.conf configuration file or by using the localectl utility. Also, you can use the graphical user interface to perform the task; for a description of this method, see Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide.\n\n2.1. Setting the System Locale\nSystem-wide locale settings are stored in the /etc/locale.conf file, which is read at early boot by the systemd daemon. The locale settings configured in /etc/locale.conf are inherited by every service or user, unless individual programs or individual users override them.\n\nThe basic file format of /etc/locale.conf is a newline-separated list of variable assignments. For example, German locale with English messages in /etc/locale.conf looks as follows:\n\nLANG=de_DE.UTF-8\nLC_MESSAGES=C\nHere, the LC_MESSAGES option determines the locale used for diagnostic messages written to the standard error output. To further specify locale settings in /etc/locale.conf, you can use several other options, the most relevant are summarized in Table 2.1, “Options configurable in /etc/locale.conf”. See the locale(7) manual page for detailed information on these options. Note that the LC_ALL option, which represents all possible options, should not be configured in /etc/locale.conf.\n\nTable 2.1. Options configurable in /etc/locale.conf\n\n\nOption        Description\nLANG\n\nProvides a default value for the system locale.\n\nLC_COLLATE\n\nChanges the behavior of functions which compare strings in the local alphabet.\n\nLC_CTYPE\n\nChanges the behavior of the character handling and classification functions and the multibyte character functions.\n\nLC_NUMERIC\n\nDescribes the way numbers are usually printed, with details such as decimal point versus decimal comma.\n\nLC_TIME\n\nChanges the display of the current time, 24-hour versus 12-hour clock.\n\nLC_MESSAGES\n\nDetermines the locale used for diagnostic messages written to the standard error output.\n\n2.1.1. Displaying the Current Status\nThe localectl command can be used to query and change the system locale and keyboard layout settings. To show the current settings, use the status option:\n\nlocalectl status\nExample 2.1. Displaying the Current Status\n\nThe output of the previous command lists the currently set locale, keyboard layout configured for the console and for the X11 window system.\n\n~]$ localectl status\n  System Locale: LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n    VC Keymap: us\n   X11 Layout: n/a\n2.1.2. Listing Available Locales\nTo list all locales available for your system, type:\n\nlocalectl list-locales\nExample 2.2. Listing Locales\n\nImagine you want to select a specific English locale, but you are not sure if it is available on the system. You can check that by listing all English locales with the following command:\n\n~]$ localectl list-locales | grep en_\nen_AG\nen_AG.utf8\nen_AU\nen_AU.iso88591\nen_AU.utf8\nen_BW\nen_BW.iso88591\nen_BW.utf8\n\noutput truncated\n2.1.3. Setting the Locale\nTo set the default system locale, use the following command as root:\n\nlocalectl set-locale LANG=locale\nReplace locale with the locale name, found with the localectl list-locales command. The above syntax can also be used to configure parameters from Table 2.1, “Options configurable in /etc/locale.conf”.\n\nExample 2.3. Changing the Default Locale\n\nFor example, if you want to set British English as your default locale, first find the name of this locale by using list-locales. Then, as root, type the command in the following form:\n\n~]# localectl set-locale LANG=en_GB.utf8\n2.1.4. Making System Locale Settings Permanent when Installing with Kickstart\nWhen Red Hat Enterprise Linux is installed with the Red Hat Kickstart installation method, setting of the system locales might not be persistent after an upgrade of the operating system.\n\nWhen the %packages section of the Kickstart file includes the --instLang option, the _install_langs RPM macro is set to the particular value for this installation, and the set of installed locales is adjusted accordingly. However, this adjustment affects only this installation, not subsequent upgrades. If an upgrade reinstalls the glibc package, the entire set of locales is upgraded instead of only the locales you requested during the installation.\n\nTo avoid this, make the choice of locales permanent. You have these options:\n\nIf you have not started the Kickstart installation, modify the Kickstart file to include instructions for setting RPM macros globally by applying this procedure: Setting RPM macros during the Kickstart installation\nIf you have already installed the system, set RPM macros globally on the system by applying this procedure: Setting RPM macros globally\nSetting RPM macros during the Kickstart installation\n\nModify the %post section of the Kickstart file:\n\nLANG=en_US\necho \"%_install_langs $LANG\" > /etc/rpm/macros.language-conf\n\nyum-config-manager --setopt=override_install_langs=$LANG --save\nModify the %packages section of the Kickstart file:\n\n%packages\nyum-utils*\n%end\nSetting RPM macros globally\n\nCreate the RPM configuration file at /etc/rpm/macros.language-conf with the following contents:\n\n%_install_langs LANG\nLANG is the value of the instLang option.\n\nUpdate the /etc/yum.conf file with:\n\noverride_install_langs=LANG\n2.2. Changing the Keyboard Layout\nThe keyboard layout settings enable the user to control the layout used on the text console and graphical user interfaces.\n\n2.2.1. Displaying the Current Settings\nAs mentioned before, you can check your current keyboard layout configuration with the following command:\n\nlocalectl status\nExample 2.4. Displaying the Keyboard Settings\n\nIn the following output, you can see the keyboard layout configured for the virtual console and for the X11 window system.\n\n~]$ localectl status\n  System Locale: LANG=en_US.utf8\n    VC Keymap: us\n   X11 Layout: us\n2.2.2. Listing Available Keymaps\nTo list all available keyboard layouts that can be configured on your system, type:\n\nlocalectl list-keymaps\nExample 2.5. Searching for a Particular Keymap\n\nYou can use grep to search the output of the previous command for a specific keymap name. There are often multiple keymaps compa\nCharacters remaining: 0\nPayment Request Agreement \nPlease read this statement and indicate your agreement by checking the \"I have read...\" box.

System Locale and Keyboard Configuration\nThe system locale specifies the language settings of system services and user interfaces. The keyboard layout settings control the layout used on the text console and graphical user interfaces.\n\nThese settings can be made by modifying the /etc/locale.conf configuration file or by using the localectl utility. Also, you can use the graphical user interface to perform the task; for a description of this method, see Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide.\n\n2.1. Setting the System Locale\nSystem-wide locale settings are stored in the /etc/locale.conf file, which is read at early boot by the systemd daemon. The locale settings configured in /etc/locale.conf are inherited by every service or user, unless individual programs or individual users override them.\n\nThe basic file format of /etc/locale.conf is a newline-separated list of variable assignments. For example, German locale with English messages in /etc/locale.conf looks as follows:\n\nLANG=de_DE.UTF-8\nLC_MESSAGES=C\nHere, the LC_MESSAGES option determines the locale used for diagnostic messages written to the standard error output. To further specify locale settings in /etc/locale.conf, you can use several other options, the most relevant are summarized in Table 2.1, “Options configurable in /etc/locale.conf”. See the locale(7) manual page for detailed information on these options. Note that the LC_ALL option, which represents all possible options, should not be configured in /etc/locale.conf.\n\nTable 2.1. Options configurable in /etc/locale.conf\n\n\nOption        Description\nLANG\n\nProvides a default value for the system locale.\n\nLC_COLLATE\n\nChanges the behavior of functions which compare strings in the local alphabet.\n\nLC_CTYPE\n\nChanges the behavior of the character handling and classification functions and the multibyte character functions.\n\nLC_NUMERIC\n\nDescribes the way numbers are usually printed, with details such as decimal point versus decimal comma.\n\nLC_TIME\n\nChanges the display of the current time, 24-hour versus 12-hour clock.\n\nLC_MESSAGES\n\nDetermines the locale used for diagnostic messages written to the standard error output.\n\n2.1.1. Displaying the Current Status\nThe localectl command can be used to query and change the system locale and keyboard layout settings. To show the current settings, use the status option:\n\nlocalectl status\nExample 2.1. Displaying the Current Status\n\nThe output of the previous command lists the currently set locale, keyboard layout configured for the console and for the X11 window system.\n\n~]$ localectl status\n  System Locale: LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n    VC Keymap: us\n   X11 Layout: n/a\n2.1.2. Listing Available Locales\nTo list all locales available for your system, type:\n\nlocalectl list-locales\nExample 2.2. Listing Locales\n\nImagine you want to select a specific English locale, but you are not sure if it is available on the system. You can check that by listing all English locales with the following command:\n\n~]$ localectl list-locales | grep en_\nen_AG\nen_AG.utf8\nen_AU\nen_AU.iso88591\nen_AU.utf8\nen_BW\nen_BW.iso88591\nen_BW.utf8\n\noutput truncated\n2.1.3. Setting the Locale\nTo set the default system locale, use the following command as root:\n\nlocalectl set-locale LANG=locale\nReplace locale with the locale name, found with the localectl list-locales command. The above syntax can also be used to configure parameters from Table 2.1, “Options configurable in /etc/locale.conf”.\n\nExample 2.3. Changing the Default Locale\n\nFor example, if you want to set British English as your default locale, first find the name of this locale by using list-locales. Then, as root, type the command in the following form:\n\n~]# localectl set-locale LANG=en_GB.utf8\n2.1.4. Making System Locale Settings Permanent when Installing with Kickstart\nWhen Red Hat Enterprise Linux is installed with the Red Hat Kickstart installation method, setting of the system locales might not be persistent after an upgrade of the operating system.\n\nWhen the %packages section of the Kickstart file includes the --instLang option, the _install_langs RPM macro is set to the particular value for this installation, and the set of installed locales is adjusted accordingly. However, this adjustment affects only this installation, not subsequent upgrades. If an upgrade reinstalls the glibc package, the entire set of locales is upgraded instead of only the locales you requested during the installation.\n\nTo avoid this, make the choice of locales permanent. You have these options:\n\nIf you have not started the Kickstart installation, modify the Kickstart file to include instructions for setting RPM macros globally by applying this procedure: Setting RPM macros during the Kickstart installation\nIf you have already installed the system, set RPM macros globally on the system by applying this procedure: Setting RPM macros globally\nSetting RPM macros during the Kickstart installation\n\nModify the %post section of the Kickstart file:\n\nLANG=en_US\necho \"%_install_langs $LANG\" > /etc/rpm/macros.language-conf\n\nyum-config-manager --setopt=override_install_langs=$LANG --save\nModify the %packages section of the Kickstart file:\n\n%packages\nyum-utils*\n%end\nSetting RPM macros globally\n\nCreate the RPM configuration file at /etc/rpm/macros.language-conf with the following contents:\n\n%_install_langs LANG\nLANG is the value of the instLang option.\n\nUpdate the /etc/yum.conf file with:\n\noverride_install_langs=LANG\n2.2. Changing the Keyboard Layout\nThe keyboard layout settings enable the user to control the layout used on the text console and graphical user interfaces.\n\n2.2.1. Displaying the Current Settings\nAs mentioned before, you can check your current keyboard layout configuration with the following command:\n\nlocalectl status\nExample 2.4. Displaying the Keyboard Settings\n\nIn the following output, you can see the keyboard layout configured for the virtual console and for the X11 window system.\n\n~]$ localectl status\n  System Locale: LANG=en_US.utf8\n    VC Keymap: us\n   X11 Layout: us\n2.2.2. Listing Available Keymaps\nTo list all available keyboard layouts that can be configured on your system, type:\n\nlocalectl list-keymaps\nExample 2.5. Searching for a Particular Keymap\n\nYou can use grep to search the output of the previous command for a specific keymap name. There are often multiple keymaps compa\nCharacters remaining: 0\nPayment Request Agreement \nPlease read this statement and indicate your agreement by checking the \"I have read...\" box.

By using a shelf registration statement, we may sell, at any time and from time to time in one or more offerings, any combination of the securities described in this prospectus.\n\nWe have not authorized anyone to provide you with different information. We are not making an offer of these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer is not permitted. If you are in a jurisdiction where offers to sell, or solicitations of offers to purchase, the securities offered by this document are unlawful, or if you are a person to whom it is unlawful to direct these types of activities, then the offer presented in this document does not extend to you. You should not assume that the information in this prospectus or a prospectus supplement is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front of the document.\n\nThis prospectus provides you with a general description of the securities we may offer. Each time we sell securities, we will provide a prospectus supplement containing specific information about the terms of that offering. That prospectus supplement may include a discussion of any risk factors or other special considerations applicable to those securities. The prospectus supplement also may add, update, or change information in this prospectus. If there is any inconsistency between the information in this prospectus and any prospectus supplement, you should rely on the information in the prospectus supplement. You should read both this prospectus and any prospectus supplement together with the additional information described under the heading “Where You Can Find More Information.”\n\nThe registration statement containing this prospectus, including the exhibits to the registration statement, provides additional information about us and the securities offered under this prospectus.\n\nThe exhibits to the registration statement contain the full text of certain contracts and other important documents we have summarized in this prospectus. You should review the full text of these documents because these summaries may not contain all the information that you may find important in deciding whether to purchase the securities we offer.

All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the annual period ended December 31, 2022, under “Item 1A of Part I — Risk Factors.” Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can or will be achieved, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements which speak only as of the date they are made. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures we make in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”\n\nABOUT THE REGISTRANT\n\nWe seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees.\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nInvesting in our securities involves risk. Before you decide whether to purchase any of our securities, in addition to the other information, documents, or reports included in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement or other offering materials, you should carefully consider the risk factors in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in any prospectus supplement as well as our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus and any prospectus supplement in its entirety, as the same may be amended, supplemented, or superseded from time to time by our filings under the Exchange Act. For more information, see the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.” These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and could result in a partial or complete loss of your investment.\n\n \n\n3\n\nTable of Contents\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\n\nUnless otherwise stated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we intend to use the net proceeds of any offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, repayment of debt, acquisitions, investments, working capital, investments in our subsidiaries, capital expenditures, and repurchases of outstanding shares of common stock. Net proceeds may be temporarily invested prior to use.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES\n\nThe following is a general description of the debt securities that we may offer from time to time. The particular terms of the debt securities offered by any prospectus supplement and the extent, if any, to which the general provisions described below may apply to those securities will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. We also may sell hybrid securities that combine certain features of debt securities and other securities described in this prospectus. As you read this section, please remember that the specific terms of a debt security as described in the applicable prospectus supplement will supplement and may modify or replace the general terms described in this section. If there are any differences between the applicable prospectus supplement and this prospectus, the applicable prospectus supplement will control. As a result, the statements we make in this section may not apply to the debt security you purchase.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. will be the issuer of any debt securities we may offer and references to “we,” “our,” or “us” in this description do not, unless the context otherwise indicates, include any of its subsidiaries. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this section have the respective meanings set forth in the applicable indenture.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe debt securities that we may offer will be either senior debt securities or subordinated debt securities. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, any senior debt securities will be issued under the indenture, dated as of November 29, 2012, between Amazon.com, Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, National Association as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, which we refer to as the senior indenture. Any subordinated debt securities will be issued under a different indenture, which we refer to as the subordinated indenture, to be entered into between us and the trustee named in the applicable prospectus supplement. We refer to both the senior indenture and the subordinated indenture as the indentures, and to each of the trustees under the indentures as a trustee. The terms of each series of debt securities will be set forth in a resolution of the board of directors of the Registrant, an officers’ certificate or by a supplemental indenture. You should read the indentures, including any amendments or supplements or any officers’ certificate setting forth the terms of any series of notes, carefully to fully understand the terms of the debt securities. The forms of the indentures have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. The indentures are subject to, and are governed by, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”).\n\nAny senior debt securities that we may issue will be our unsubordinated obligations. They will rank equally with each other and all of our other unsubordinated debt, unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement. Any subordinated debt securities that we may issue will be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of our senior debt. See “Subordination of Subordinated Debt Securities.” The subordinated debt securities will rank equally with each other, unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement. We will indicate in each applicable prospectus supplement, as of the most recent practicable date, the aggregate amount of our outstanding debt that would rank senior to the subordinated debt securities.\n\nThe indentures do not limit the amount of debt securities that can be issued thereunder and provide that debt securities of any series may be issued thereunder up to the aggregate principal amount that we may authorize from time to time. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement, the indentures do not limit\n\n \n\n4\n\nTable of Contents\nthe amount of other indebtedness or securities that we may issue. We may issue debt securities of the same series at more than one time and, unless prohibited by the terms of the series, we may reopen a series for issuances of additional debt securities without the consent of the holders of the outstanding debt securities of that series. All debt securities issued as a series, including those issued pursuant to any reopening of a series, will vote together as a single class. In addition, we will describe in the applicable prospectus supplement material U.S. federal tax considerations and any other special considerations for any debt securities we sell which are denominated in a currency or currency unit other than U.S. dollars. Any taxes withheld or deducted from payments in respect of the debt securities and paid to the relevant tax authority shall be deemed to have been paid to the applicable holder.\n\nReference is made to the prospectus supplement for the following and other possible terms of each series of the debt securities with respect to which this prospectus is being delivered:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe title of the debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nany limit upon the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of the series that may be authenticated and delivered under the applicable indenture, except for debt securities authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, other debt securities of that series;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe date or dates on which the principal and premium, if any, of the debt securities of the series is payable;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe rate or rates, which may be fixed or variable, at which the debt securities of the series shall bear interest or the manner of calculation of such rate or rates, if any, including any procedures to vary or reset such rate or rates, and the basis upon which interest will be calculated if other than that of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe place or places where the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the debt securities of the series shall be payable, where the debt securities of such series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon us with respect to the debt securities of such series and the applicable indenture may be served, and the method of such payment, if by wire transfer, mail, or other means if other than as set forth in the applicable indenture;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the dates on which such interest will be payable or the manner of determination of such dates, and the record date for the determination of holders to whom interest is payable on any such dates;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nany trustees, authenticating agents or paying agents with respect to such series, if different from those set forth in the applicable indenture;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe right, if any, to extend the interest payment periods or defer the payment of interest and the duration of such extension or deferral;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe period or periods within which, the price or prices at which and the terms and conditions upon which, debt securities of the series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nour obligation, if any, to redeem, purchase, or repay debt securities of the series pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provisions, including payments made in cash in anticipation of future sinking fund obligations, or at the option of a holder thereof and the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which, and the terms and conditions upon which, debt securities of the series shall be redeemed, purchased or repaid, in whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe form of the debt securities of the series including the form of the trustee’s certificate of authentication for such series;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nif other than denominations of $2,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, the denominations in which the debt securities of the series shall be issuable;\n\n \n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n         •                 \nthe currency or currencies in which payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, debt securities of the series shall be payable;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nif the principal amount payable at the stated maturity of debt securities of the series will not be determinable as of any one or more dates prior to such stated maturity, the amount which will be deemed to be such principal amount as of any such date for any purpose, including the portion of the principal amount thereof that will be due and payable upon declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof or upon any maturity other than the stated maturity or that will be deemed to be outstanding as of any such date, or, in any such case, the manner in which such deemed principal amount is to be determined;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe terms of any repurchase or remarketing rights;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nif the debt securities of the series shall be issued in whole or in part in the form of a global security or securities, the type of global security to be issued;

Any such obligation applicable to a series of debt securities will be described in the prospectus supplement relating thereto.\n\nThe statements made hereunder relating to the indentures and any debt securities that we may issue are summaries of certain provisions thereof and are qualified in their entirety by reference to all provisions of the indentures and the debt securities and the descriptions thereof, if different, in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nSubordination of Subordinated Debt Securities\n\nWe will set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement the terms and conditions, if any, upon which any series of subordinated debt securities is subordinated to debt securities of another series or to our other indebtedness. The terms will include a description of:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe indebtedness ranking senior to the debt securities being offered;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe restrictions, if any, on payments to the holders of the debt securities being offered while a default with respect to the senior indebtedness is continuing; and\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe provisions requiring holders of the debt securities being offered to remit some payments to the holders of senior indebtedness.\n\nRedemption\n\nIf specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, we may redeem the debt securities of any series, as a whole or in part, at our option on and after the dates and in accordance with the terms established for such series, if any, in the applicable prospectus supplement. If we redeem the debt securities of any series, we also must pay accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption on such debt securities.\n\nSelection and Notice\n\nIf less than all of the debt securities of a series are to be redeemed at any time, the trustee will select the debt securities of such series for redemption by lot, based on the applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).\n\nNo debt securities in principal amount of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail (or in cases of notes held in book entry form, by electronic transmission) at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of debt securities of such series to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the debt securities of such series or a satisfaction and discharge of the indenture.\n\nIf any debt security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that debt security will state the portion of the principal amount of that debt security that is to be redeemed. For debt securities issued in certificated form, a new certificate in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original debt security will be issued in the name of the holder of the original debt security upon cancellation of the\n\n \n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\noriginal debt security. Debt securities called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the debt securities or portions of the debt securities called for redemption.\n\nThe trustee will not be liable for selections made by it as contemplated in this section. For any debt securities which are represented by global securities held on behalf of DTC, Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”), or Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”), notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to DTC, Euroclear, or Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.\n\nReports\n\nWhether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, so long as any debt securities are outstanding, we shall file with the trustee, within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and regulations, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) that we would be required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. We shall be deemed to have complied with the previous sentence to the extent that such information, documents and reports are filed with the SEC via EDGAR, or any successor electronic delivery procedure. Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the trustee is for informational purposes only, and the trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including our compliance with any covenants under the indenture (as to which the trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on officers’ certificates).\n\nEvents of Default & Effects of an Event of Default\n\nThe following will be “Events of Default” with respect to debt securities of a particular series, except to the extent provided in the supplemental indenture, officers’ certificate, or resolution of our board of directors pursuant to which a series of debt securities is issued:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nfailure to pay any interest on any of the debt securities of such series within 30 days after such interest becomes due and payable;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nfailure to pay principal of (or premium, if any, on) any of the debt securities of such series at maturity, or if applicable, the redemption price, when the same becomes due and payable by the terms of the debt securities of such series;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nfailure to pay any sinking fund installment as and when the same shall become due and payable by the terms of the debt securities of such series, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nfailure to comply with any of the covenants or agreements in any of the debt securities of such series or the indenture (other than an agreement or covenant that we included in the indenture solely for the benefit of another series of debt securities) for 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to us by the trustee or to us by the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities of a series affected by that failure, a written notice specifying such failure and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a “notice of default” under the indenture;\n\n \n\n         •                 \ncertain events involving our bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization; and\n\n \n\n         •                 \nany other Event of Default provided in the supplemental indenture, officers’ certificate, or resolution of our board of directors under which such series of debt securities is issued or in the form of security for such series.\n\nA default under one series of debt securities issued under the indenture will not necessarily be a default under another series of debt securities under the indenture. The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of a\n\n \n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\nseries of debt securities issued under such indenture of any default or event of default (except in any payment on the debt securities of such series) if the trustee considers it in the interest of the holders of the debt securities of that series to do so.\n\nIf an event of default for a series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may require us to pay immediately the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on all the debt securities of that series. If an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization occurs with respect to us, the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on the debt securities of that series will become immediately due and payable without any action on the part of the trustee or any holder. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding may in some cases rescind this accelerated payment requirement.\n\nA holder of debt securities of any series may pursue any remedy under the indenture applicable to the debt securities of that series only if:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe holder gives the trustee written notice of a continuing event of default;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding make a written request to the trustee to pursue the remedy;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe holder furnishes to the trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against loss, liability, or expense;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe trustee fails to act for a period of 60 days after receipt of notice and furnishing of indemnity; and\n\n \n\n         •                 \nduring that 60-day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of that series do not give the trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.\n\nThis provision does not, however, affect the right of any holder to sue for enforcement of any overdue payment with respect to the debt securities of such series. In most cases, holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of any series then outstanding may direct the time, method, and place of:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nconducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee with respect to the debt securities of such series; and\n\n \n\n         •                 \nexercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee not relating to or arising under an event of default with respect to the debt securities of such series.\n\nThe indenture will require us to file with the trustee each year a written statement as to our compliance with the covenants contained in the indenture, and we are required upon becoming aware of any default or Event of Default, to deliver to the trustee a written statement specifying such default or Event of Default.\n\nCovenants\n\nUnless we indicate otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to protect holders of the debt securities in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.\n\nConsolidation, Merger, or Sale\n\nWe will covenant not to consolidate with or merge into any other person or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our and our subsidiaries’, taken as a whole, assets to any person unless either we are the surviving corporation or the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is a corporation organized under the laws of the United States or, if such person is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the notes is a corporation organized under any such laws, and any successor or purchaser expressly assumes our\n\n \n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\nobligations under the debt securities by an indenture supplemental to the indenture, and immediately after which, no event of default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an event of default, shall have occurred and be continuing. An officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel will be delivered to the trustee, which will serve as conclusive evidence of compliance with these provisions.\n\nModification and Waiver\n\nExcept as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the indenture or the debt securities of any series may be amended or supplemented, and waivers may be obtained, with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of the applicable series at the time outstanding (including, without limitation, additional debt securities of such series, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, debt securities of such series), and any existing default or Event of Default (other than a default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium on, if any, or interest on, debt securities of such series, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of such indenture or the applicable debt securities may be waived with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of the applicable series at the time outstanding (including, without limitation, additional debt securities of such series, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such series). Without the consent of each holder of outstanding debt securities affected thereby, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any debt securities held by a non-consenting holder):\n\n \n\n         •                 \nreduce the percentage in principal amount of debt securities, the consent of whose holders is required for any amendment, supplement, or waiver;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nreduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on the debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nreduce the principal or change the stated maturity of any debt securities of any series;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nreduce any premium payable on the redemption of any debt security, change the time at which any debt security may or must be redeemed or alter or waive any of the provisions with respect to the redemption of such debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nmake payments on any debt security payable in currency other than as originally stated in such debt security;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nimpair the holder’s right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on any debt security; or\n\n \n\n         •                 \nwaive a continuing default or event of default regarding any payment on the debt securities.\n\nNotwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of debt securities, we and the trustee may amend or supplement the indenture or the applicable debt securities in certain circumstances, including:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, or inconsistency;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto provide for the assumption of our obligations under the indenture by a successor or transferee upon any merger, consolidation, or asset transfer;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto provide for uncertificated debt securities in addition to or in place of certificated debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto provide any security for or guarantees of the debt securities or for the addition of an additional obligor on the debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto comply with any requirement to effect or maintain the qualification of the indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, if applicable;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto add covenants that would benefit the holders of any outstanding series of debt securities or to surrender any of our rights under the indenture;\n\n \n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n         •                 \nto add additional Events of Default with respect to any series of debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto change or eliminate any of the provisions of the indenture; provided that any such change or elimination shall not become effective with respect to any outstanding debt security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture which is entitled to the benefit of such provision;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto provide for the issuance of and establish forms and terms and conditions of a new series of debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of debt securities otherwise in accordance with the defeasance provisions of the indenture; provided that any such action does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of outstanding debt securities of such series in any material respect;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto issue additional debt securities of any series; provided that such additional debt securities have the same terms as, and be deemed part of the same series as, the applicable series of debt securities to the extent required under the indenture;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of outstanding debt securities in any material respect; or\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee with respect to the debt securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of the indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trust by more than one trustee.\n\nThe holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of each series then outstanding may on behalf of the holders of all of the debt securities of such series waive any past default with respect to those debt securities, except a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any debt security of such series (provided, that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of each series then outstanding may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration).\n\nA supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant, Event of Default or other provision of the indenture that has been expressly included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of securities, if any, or which modifies the rights of the holders of securities of such series with respect to such covenant, Event of Default or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under the indenture of the holders of securities of any other series that does not have the benefit of such covenant, Event of Default or other provision. It will not be necessary for the consent of the holders to approve the particular form of any proposed supplement, amendment, or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance of it.\n\nInformation Concerning the Trustee\n\nIf an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will be required to use the degree of care and skill of a prudent person in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The trustee will become obligated to exercise any of its powers under the indenture at the request of any of the holders of any debt securities issued under the indenture only after those holders have furnished the trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it.\n\nIf the trustee becomes a creditor of ours, it will be subject to limitations in the indenture on its rights to obtain payment of claims or to realize on certain property received for any such claim, as security or otherwise. The trustee is permitted to engage in other transactions with us. If, however, it acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict, resign, or obtain an order from the SEC permitting it to remain as trustee.\n\nPaying Agent, Registrar, and Transfer Agent\n\nFor any debt securities we issue, we will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”). We, upon written notice to the trustee accompanied by an officers’ certificate, may appoint one or more Paying\n\n \n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\nAgents, other than the trustee, for all or any series of such debt securities. If we fail to appoint or maintain another entity as Paying Agent, the trustee shall act as such. We or any of our subsidiaries, upon notice to the trustee, may act as Paying Agent.\n\nWe will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”). We, upon written notice to the trustee accompanied by an officers’ certificate, may appoint one or more Registrars, other than the trustee, for all or any series of debt securities. If we fail to appoint or maintain another entity as Registrar, the trustee shall act as such. We or any of our subsidiaries, upon notice to the trustee, may act as Registrar.\n\nWe will also maintain one or more transfer agents (each, a “Transfer Agent”). Each Transfer Agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent. We, upon written notice to the trustee accompanied by an officers’ certificate, may appoint one or more Transfer Agents, other than the trustee, for all or any series of debt securities. If we fail to appoint or maintain another entity as Transfer Agent, the trustee shall act as such. We or any of our subsidiaries, upon notice to the trustee, may act as Transfer Agent.\n\nThe Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of debt securities outstanding from time to time, and the Paying Agents will make payments on and facilitate transfer of debt securities on our behalf. We may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or transfer agents without prior notice to the holders of debt securities.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe indenture and any debt securities issued thereunder shall be deemed to be a contract made under the internal laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of laws principles that would require the application of any other law. The indenture is subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act that are required to be part of the indenture and shall, to the extent applicable, be governed by such provisions.\n\nSatisfaction and Discharge of Indenture\n\nThe indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to a series of debt securities when either:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nwe have delivered to the trustee for cancellation all outstanding securities of such series, other than any securities that have been destroyed, lost, or stolen and that have been replaced or paid as provided in the indenture;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nall outstanding securities of such series that have not been delivered to the trustee for cancellation have become due and payable or are by their terms to become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the trustee for the giving of notice of redemption, and we shall have irrevocably deposited with the trustee as trust funds the entire amount, in cash in U.S. dollars or noncallable U.S. governmental obligations, or a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay at maturity or upon redemption all securities of such series, including principal of and any premium and interest due or to become due to such date of maturity or date fixed for redemption, as the case may be; or\n\n \n\n         •                 \nwe have properly fulfilled any other means of satisfaction and discharge that may be set forth in the terms of the securities of such series.\n\nIn each case, we will also pay all other sums payable by us under the indenture with respect to the securities of such series and deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel and an officers’ certificate, each stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge with respect to the securities of such series have been complied with.\n\n \n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\nDefeasance\n\nThe term defeasance means the discharge of some or all of our obligations under the indenture. If we deposit with the trustee funds or U.S. government securities, or a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to make payments on any series of debt securities on the dates those payments are due and payable, then, at our option, either of the following will occur:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nwe will be discharged from our obligations with respect to the debt securities of such series (“legal defeasance”); or\n\n \n\n         •                 \nwe will no longer have any obligation to comply with the restrictive covenants under the indenture, and the related events of default will no longer apply to us (“covenant defeasance”).\n\nIf we defease any series of debt securities, the holders of the defeased debt securities of such series will not be entitled to the benefits of the indenture under which such series was issued, except for our obligation to register the transfer or exchange of the debt securities of such series, replace stolen, lost or mutilated debt securities or maintain paying agencies and hold moneys for payment in trust. In the case of covenant defeasance, our obligation to pay principal, premium, and interest on the debt securities of such series will also survive. We will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance would not cause the holders of the debt securities of such series to recognize income, gain, or loss for federal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service or a change in law to that effect.\n\nSame-Day Settlement and Payment\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement, we expect the debt securities will trade in the same-day funds settlement system of DTC until maturity or until we issue the debt securities in certificated form. DTC will therefore require secondary market trading activity in the debt securities to settle in immediately available funds. We can give no assurance as to the effect, if any, of settlement in immediately available funds on trading activity in the debt securities.\n\nBook-Entry, Delivery, and Form\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities of each series will be issued in the form of one or more global debt securities, in definitive, fully registered form without interest coupons, each of which we refer to as a “global security.” Each such global security will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of a nominee of DTC in New York, New York for the accounts of participants in DTC.\n\nInvestors may hold their interests in a global security directly through DTC if they are DTC participants, or indirectly through organizations that are DTC participants. Except in the limited circumstances described below, holders of debt securities represented by interests in a global security will not be entitled to receive their debt securities in fully registered certificated form.\n\nDTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities of institutions that have accounts with DTC (“participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s book-entry system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n \n\n13\n\nTable of Contents\nOwnership of Beneficial Interests\n\nUpon the issuance of each global security, DTC will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the respective principal amount of the individual beneficial interests represented by the global security to the accounts of participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be limited to participants or persons that may hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be shown on, and the transfer of those ownership interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to participants’ interests) and such participants (with respect to the owners of beneficial interests in the global security other than participants).\n\nSo long as DTC or its nominee is the registered holder and owner of a global security, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole legal owner of the debt security represented by the global security for all purposes under the indenture, the debt securities and applicable law. Except as set forth below, owners of beneficial interests in a global security will not be entitled to receive certificated debt securities and will not be considered to be the owners or holders of any debt securities represented by the global security. We understand that under existing industry practice, in the event an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any actions that DTC, as the holder of the global security, is entitled to take, DTC would authorize the participants to take such action, and that participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through such participants to take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. No beneficial owner of an interest in a global security will be able to transfer such interest except in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures, in addition to those provided for under the indenture. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of others, the ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a global security to pledge that interest to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise to take actions in respect of that interest, may be impaired by the lack of a physical certificate representing that interest.\n\nAll payments on the debt securities represented by a global security registered in the name of and held by DTC or its nominee will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner and holder of the global security.\n\nWe expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest in respect of a global security, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the global security as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the global security held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is now the case with securities held for accounts for customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. These payments, however, will be the responsibility of such participants and indirect participants, and neither we, the trustee nor any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in any global security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and its participants or the relationship between such participants and the owners of beneficial interests in the global security.\n\nUnless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for certificated debt securities, each global security may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds.\n\nWe expect that DTC will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of debt securities only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in a global security are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction.\n\n \n\n \n\n14\n\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we expect that DTC will agree to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in each global security among participants of DTC, DTC is under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of us, the underwriters or the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance or nonperformance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.\n\nThe indenture provides that the global securities will be exchanged for debt securities in certificated form of like tenor and of an equal principal amount, in authorized denominations in the following limited circumstances:\n\n(1) DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository or if DTC ceases to be eligible under the indenture and we do not appoint a successor depository within 90 days; or\n\n(2) we determine that the debt securities will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver to the trustee an order to such effect.\n\nThese certificated debt securities will be registered in such name or names as DTC will instruct the trustee. It is expected that such instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in global securities.\n\nThe information in this section of this prospectus concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we do not take responsibility for this information.\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream\n\nIf the depositary for a global security is DTC, you may hold interests in the global security through Clearstream or Euroclear, in each case, as a participant in DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests, in each case, on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in the names of Euroclear and Clearstream on the books of their respective depositaries, which in turn will hold such interests in customers’ securities in the depositaries’ names on DTC’s books.\n\nPayments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices and other matters relating to the debt securities made through Euroclear or Clearstream must comply with the rules and procedures of those systems. Those systems could change their rules and procedures at any time. We have no control over those systems or their participants, and we take no responsibility for their activities. Transactions between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, on one hand, and other participants in DTC, on the other hand, would also be subject to DTC’s rules and procedures.\n\nInvestors will be able to make and receive through Euroclear and Clearstream payments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices and other transactions involving any securities held through those systems only on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States.\n\nIn addition, because of time-zone differences, U.S. investors who hold their interests in the debt securities through these systems and wish on a particular day, to transfer their interests, or to receive or make a payment or delivery or exercise any other right with respect to their interests, may find that the transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, as applicable. Thus, investors who wish to exercise rights that expire on a particular day may need to act before the expiration date. In addition, investors who hold their interests through both DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream may need to make special arrangements to finance any purchase or sales of their interests between the U.S. and European clearing systems, and those transactions may settle later than transactions within one clearing system.\n\n \n\n15\n\nTable of Contents\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK\n\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AMZN.” All outstanding shares of common stock are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.\n\nThe following description of the terms of our common stock is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), both of which are exhibits to this prospectus.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nThe holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted for action by our stockholders.

A similar standard is applicable in the case of derivative actions and actions brought directly by the corporation, except that indemnification only extends to expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such actions, and the statute requires court approval before there can be any indemnification of expenses if the person seeking indemnification has been found liable to the corporation. In addition, the statute requires indemnification of directors and officers to the extent they have been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defending an action, suit, or proceeding (whether brought by a third party or by or on behalf of the corporation). The statute also permits a corporation to pay expenses of defense in advance of the final disposition of an action, suit, or proceeding upon receipt (in the case of a current director or officer) of an undertaking to repay any amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified. The statute provides that it is not exclusive of other indemnification that may be granted by a corporation’s bylaws, disinterested director vote, stockholder vote, agreement, or otherwise.\n\nSection 10 of Amazon.com, Inc.’s (the “Registrant”) Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) requires indemnification to the full extent permitted under Delaware law as it now exists or may hereafter be amended. Subject to any restrictions imposed by Delaware law, the Bylaws provide a right to indemnification for all expense, liability, and loss (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by any person in connection with any actual or threatened action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative by reason of the fact that such person is or was serving as a director or officer of the Registrant or that, being or having been a director or officer of the Registrant, such person is or was serving at the request of the Registrant as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan. Directors and officers also have the right under\n\n \n\nII-1\n\nTable of Contents\nSection 10 of the Bylaws to be paid expenses incurred in defending any such action, suit, or proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided that any advancement of expenses incurred by an individual in his or her capacity as a director or officer (but not in any other capacity) will be made only upon delivery to the Registrant of an undertaking, by or on behalf of the director or officer, to repay any amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined, by a final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal, that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified for the expenses under Section 10 or otherwise.\n\nDirectors and officers of the Registrant are also entitled to indemnification and advancement under Section 10 of the Bylaws to the extent they serve as a director or officer of a majority-owned subsidiary of the Registrant, or in an executive or management capacity at a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise of which the Registrant or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries is a general partner or has a majority ownership interest.\n\nSection 102(b)(7) of the DGCL permits a corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation that a director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability for (i) any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) payments of unlawful dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions, or (iv) any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.\n\nArticle 10 of the Registrant’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) provides that to the full extent that the DGCL, as it now exists or may hereafter be amended, permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors, a director of the Registrant shall not be liable to the Registrant or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Any amendment to or repeal of such Article 10 shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Registrant for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.\n\nThe Registrant has entered into certain indemnification agreements with its directors. The indemnification agreements provide the Registrant’s directors with further indemnification and advancement of expenses, to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n\nThe foregoing summaries are necessarily subject to the complete text of the statute, the Certificate of Incorporation, and the Bylaws, and the arrangements referred to above and are qualified in their entirety by reference thereto.\n\n \n\nII-2\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 16.        \nExhibits.\n\nSet forth below is a list of exhibits included as part of this Registration Statement.\n\n \n\nExhibit\nNumber                  \nDescription\n\n          \nIncorporation by Reference\n(Where a report or registration statement is\n\nindicated below, that document has been\n\npreviously filed with the SEC and the\n\napplicable exhibit is incorporated by\n\nreference thereto)\n\n  4.1                  Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Amazon.com, Inc.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in the volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and\n\n(iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;\n\nprovided, however, that paragraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) above do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.\n\n(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\n(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.\n\n(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:\n\n(i) Each prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and\n\n(ii) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the\n\n \n\nII-4\n\nTable of Contents\nregistration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.\n\n(5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned Registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned Registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned Registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:\n\n(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned Registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;\n\n(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned Registrant;\n\n(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned Registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant; and\n\n(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned Registrant to the purchaser.\n\n(6) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the Registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\n(7) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\n\n \n\nII-5\n\nTable of Contents\nSIGNATURES\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the Registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing on Form S-3 and has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Seattle, State of Washington, on February 3, 2023.\n\n \n\nAMAZON.COM, INC.\nBy:                 /s/ Shelley L.

By using a shelf registration statement, we may sell, at any time and from time to time in one or more offerings, any combination of the securities described in this prospectus.\n\nWe have not authorized anyone to provide you with different information. We are not making an offer of these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer is not permitted. If you are in a jurisdiction where offers to sell, or solicitations of offers to purchase, the securities offered by this document are unlawful, or if you are a person to whom it is unlawful to direct these types of activities, then the offer presented in this document does not extend to you. You should not assume that the information in this prospectus or a prospectus supplement is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front of the document.\n\nThis prospectus provides you with a general description of the securities we may offer. Each time we sell securities, we will provide a prospectus supplement containing specific information about the terms of that offering. That prospectus supplement may include a discussion of any risk factors or other special considerations applicable to those securities. The prospectus supplement also may add, update, or change information in this prospectus. If there is any inconsistency between the information in this prospectus and any prospectus supplement, you should rely on the information in the prospectus supplement. You should read both this prospectus and any prospectus supplement together with the additional information described under the heading “Where You Can Find More Information.”\n\nThe registration statement containing this prospectus, including the exhibits to the registration statement, provides additional information about us and the securities offered under this prospectus.\n\nThe exhibits to the registration statement contain the full text of certain contracts and other important documents we have summarized in this prospectus. You should review the full text of these documents because these summaries may not contain all the information that you may find important in deciding whether to purchase the securities we offer. You may obtain copies of these documents as described below under the heading “Where You Can Find More Information.”\n\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this prospectus to the “Registrant,” “Amazon,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION\n\nWe file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy and information statements, and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the annual period ended December 31, 2022, under “Item 1A of Part I — Risk Factors.” Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can or will be achieved, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements which speak only as of the date they are made. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures we make in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”\n\nABOUT THE REGISTRANT\n\nWe seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees.\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nInvesting in our securities involves risk. Before you decide whether to purchase any of our securities, in addition to the other information, documents, or reports included in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement or other offering materials, you should carefully consider the risk factors in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in any prospectus supplement as well as our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus and any prospectus supplement in its entirety, as the same may be amended, supplemented, or superseded from time to time by our filings under the Exchange Act. For more information, see the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.” These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and could result in a partial or complete loss of your investment.\n\n \n\n3\n\nTable of Contents\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\n\nUnless otherwise stated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we intend to use the net proceeds of any offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, repayment of debt, acquisitions, investments, working capital, investments in our subsidiaries, capital expenditures, and repurchases of outstanding shares of common stock. Net proceeds may be temporarily invested prior to use.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES\n\nThe following is a general description of the debt securities that we may offer from time to time. The particular terms of the debt securities offered by any prospectus supplement and the extent, if any, to which the general provisions described below may apply to those securities will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. We also may sell hybrid securities that combine certain features of debt securities and other securities described in this prospectus. As you read this section, please remember that the specific terms of a debt security as described in the applicable prospectus supplement will supplement and may modify or replace the general terms described in this section. If there are any differences between the applicable prospectus supplement and this prospectus, the applicable prospectus supplement will control. As a result, the statements we make in this section may not apply to the debt security you purchase.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. will be the issuer of any debt securities we may offer and references to “we,” “our,” or “us” in this description do not, unless the context otherwise indicates, include any of its subsidiaries. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this section have the respective meanings set forth in the applicable indenture.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe debt securities that we may offer will be either senior debt securities or subordinated debt securities. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, any senior debt securities will be issued under the indenture, dated as of November 29, 2012, between Amazon.com, Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, National Association as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, which we refer to as the senior indenture. Any subordinated debt securities will be issued under a different indenture, which we refer to as the subordinated indenture, to be entered into between us and the trustee named in the applicable prospectus supplement. We refer to both the senior indenture and the subordinated indenture as the indentures, and to each of the trustees under the indentures as a trustee. The terms of each series of debt securities will be set forth in a resolution of the board of directors of the Registrant, an officers’ certificate or by a supplemental indenture. You should read the indentures, including any amendments or supplements or any officers’ certificate setting forth the terms of any series of notes, carefully to fully understand the terms of the debt securities. The forms of the indentures have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. The indentures are subject to, and are governed by, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”).\n\nAny senior debt securities that we may issue will be our unsubordinated obligations. They will rank equally with each other and all of our other unsubordinated debt, unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement. Any subordinated debt securities that we may issue will be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of our senior debt. See “Subordination of Subordinated Debt Securities.” The subordinated debt securities will rank equally with each other, unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement. We will indicate in each applicable prospectus supplement, as of the most recent practicable date, the aggregate amount of our outstanding debt that would rank senior to the subordinated debt securities.\n\nThe indentures do not limit the amount of debt securities that can be issued thereunder and provide that debt securities of any series may be issued thereunder up to the aggregate principal amount that we may authorize from time to time. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement, the indentures do not limit\n\n \n\n4\n\nTable of Contents\nthe amount of other indebtedness or securities that we may issue. We may issue debt securities of the same series at more than one time and, unless prohibited by the terms of the series, we may reopen a series for issuances of additional debt securities without the consent of the holders of the outstanding debt securities of that series. All debt securities issued as a series, including those issued pursuant to any reopening of a series, will vote together as a single class. In addition, we will describe in the applicable prospectus supplement material U.S. federal tax considerations and any other special considerations for any debt securities we sell which are denominated in a currency or currency unit other than U.S. dollars. Any taxes withheld or deducted from payments in respect of the debt securities and paid to the relevant tax authority shall be deemed to have been paid to the applicable holder.\n\nReference is made to the prospectus supplement for the following and other possible terms of each series of the debt securities with respect to which this prospectus is being delivered:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe title of the debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nany limit upon the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of the series that may be authenticated and delivered under the applicable indenture, except for debt securities authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, other debt securities of that series;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe date or dates on which the principal and premium, if any, of the debt securities of the series is payable;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe rate or rates, which may be fixed or variable, at which the debt securities of the series shall bear interest or the manner of calculation of such rate or rates, if any, including any procedures to vary or reset such rate or rates, and the basis upon which interest will be calculated if other than that of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe place or places where the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the debt securities of the series shall be payable, where the debt securities of such series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon us with respect to the debt securities of such series and the applicable indenture may be served, and the method of such payment, if by wire transfer, mail, or other means if other than as set forth in the applicable indenture;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the dates on which such interest will be payable or the manner of determination of such dates, and the record date for the determination of holders to whom interest is payable on any such dates;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nany trustees, authenticating agents or paying agents with respect to such series, if different from those set forth in the applicable indenture;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe right, if any, to extend the interest payment periods or defer the payment of interest and the duration of such extension or deferral;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe period or periods within which, the price or prices at which and the terms and conditions upon which, debt securities of the series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nour obligation, if any, to redeem, purchase, or repay debt securities of the series pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provisions, including payments made in cash in anticipation of future sinking fund obligations, or at the option of a holder thereof and the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which, and the terms and conditions upon which, debt securities of the series shall be redeemed, purchased or repaid, in whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe form of the debt securities of the series including the form of the trustee’s certificate of authentication for such series;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nif other than denominations of $2,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, the denominations in which the debt securities of the series shall be issuable;\n\n \n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n         •                 \nthe currency or currencies in which payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, debt securities of the series shall be payable;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nif the principal amount payable at the stated maturity of debt securities of the series will not be determinable as of any one or more dates prior to such stated maturity, the amount which will be deemed to be such principal amount as of any such date for any purpose, including the portion of the principal amount thereof that will be due and payable upon declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof or upon any maturity other than the stated maturity or that will be deemed to be outstanding as of any such date, or, in any such case, the manner in which such deemed principal amount is to be determined;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe terms of any repurchase or remarketing rights;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nif the debt securities of the series shall be issued in whole or in part in the form of a global security or securities, the type of global security to be issued;

Any such obligation applicable to a series of debt securities will be described in the prospectus supplement relating thereto.\n\nThe statements made hereunder relating to the indentures and any debt securities that we may issue are summaries of certain provisions thereof and are qualified in their entirety by reference to all provisions of the indentures and the debt securities and the descriptions thereof, if different, in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nSubordination of Subordinated Debt Securities\n\nWe will set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement the terms and conditions, if any, upon which any series of subordinated debt securities is subordinated to debt securities of another series or to our other indebtedness. The terms will include a description of:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe indebtedness ranking senior to the debt securities being offered;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe restrictions, if any, on payments to the holders of the debt securities being offered while a default with respect to the senior indebtedness is continuing; and\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe provisions requiring holders of the debt securities being offered to remit some payments to the holders of senior indebtedness.\n\nRedemption\n\nIf specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, we may redeem the debt securities of any series, as a whole or in part, at our option on and after the dates and in accordance with the terms established for such series, if any, in the applicable prospectus supplement. If we redeem the debt securities of any series, we also must pay accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption on such debt securities.\n\nSelection and Notice\n\nIf less than all of the debt securities of a series are to be redeemed at any time, the trustee will select the debt securities of such series for redemption by lot, based on the applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).\n\nNo debt securities in principal amount of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail (or in cases of notes held in book entry form, by electronic transmission) at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of debt securities of such series to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the debt securities of such series or a satisfaction and discharge of the indenture.\n\nIf any debt security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that debt security will state the portion of the principal amount of that debt security that is to be redeemed. For debt securities issued in certificated form, a new certificate in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original debt security will be issued in the name of the holder of the original debt security upon cancellation of the\n\n \n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\noriginal debt security. Debt securities called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the debt securities or portions of the debt securities called for redemption.\n\nThe trustee will not be liable for selections made by it as contemplated in this section. For any debt securities which are represented by global securities held on behalf of DTC, Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”), or Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”), notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to DTC, Euroclear, or Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.\n\nReports\n\nWhether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, so long as any debt securities are outstanding, we shall file with the trustee, within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and regulations, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) that we would be required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. We shall be deemed to have complied with the previous sentence to the extent that such information, documents and reports are filed with the SEC via EDGAR, or any successor electronic delivery procedure. Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the trustee is for informational purposes only, and the trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including our compliance with any covenants under the indenture (as to which the trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on officers’ certificates).\n\nEvents of Default & Effects of an Event of Default\n\nThe following will be “Events of Default” with respect to debt securities of a particular series, except to the extent provided in the supplemental indenture, officers’ certificate, or resolution of our board of directors pursuant to which a series of debt securities is issued:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nfailure to pay any interest on any of the debt securities of such series within 30 days after such interest becomes due and payable;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nfailure to pay principal of (or premium, if any, on) any of the debt securities of such series at maturity, or if applicable, the redemption price, when the same becomes due and payable by the terms of the debt securities of such series;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nfailure to pay any sinking fund installment as and when the same shall become due and payable by the terms of the debt securities of such series, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nfailure to comply with any of the covenants or agreements in any of the debt securities of such series or the indenture (other than an agreement or covenant that we included in the indenture solely for the benefit of another series of debt securities) for 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to us by the trustee or to us by the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities of a series affected by that failure, a written notice specifying such failure and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a “notice of default” under the indenture;\n\n \n\n         •                 \ncertain events involving our bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization; and\n\n \n\n         •                 \nany other Event of Default provided in the supplemental indenture, officers’ certificate, or resolution of our board of directors under which such series of debt securities is issued or in the form of security for such series.\n\nA default under one series of debt securities issued under the indenture will not necessarily be a default under another series of debt securities under the indenture. The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of a\n\n \n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\nseries of debt securities issued under such indenture of any default or event of default (except in any payment on the debt securities of such series) if the trustee considers it in the interest of the holders of the debt securities of that series to do so.\n\nIf an event of default for a series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may require us to pay immediately the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on all the debt securities of that series. If an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization occurs with respect to us, the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on the debt securities of that series will become immediately due and payable without any action on the part of the trustee or any holder. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding may in some cases rescind this accelerated payment requirement.\n\nA holder of debt securities of any series may pursue any remedy under the indenture applicable to the debt securities of that series only if:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe holder gives the trustee written notice of a continuing event of default;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding make a written request to the trustee to pursue the remedy;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe holder furnishes to the trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against loss, liability, or expense;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nthe trustee fails to act for a period of 60 days after receipt of notice and furnishing of indemnity; and\n\n \n\n         •                 \nduring that 60-day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of that series do not give the trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.\n\nThis provision does not, however, affect the right of any holder to sue for enforcement of any overdue payment with respect to the debt securities of such series. In most cases, holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of any series then outstanding may direct the time, method, and place of:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nconducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee with respect to the debt securities of such series; and\n\n \n\n         •                 \nexercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee not relating to or arising under an event of default with respect to the debt securities of such series.\n\nThe indenture will require us to file with the trustee each year a written statement as to our compliance with the covenants contained in the indenture, and we are required upon becoming aware of any default or Event of Default, to deliver to the trustee a written statement specifying such default or Event of Default.\n\nCovenants\n\nUnless we indicate otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to protect holders of the debt securities in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.\n\nConsolidation, Merger, or Sale\n\nWe will covenant not to consolidate with or merge into any other person or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our and our subsidiaries’, taken as a whole, assets to any person unless either we are the surviving corporation or the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is a corporation organized under the laws of the United States or, if such person is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the notes is a corporation organized under any such laws, and any successor or purchaser expressly assumes our\n\n \n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\nobligations under the debt securities by an indenture supplemental to the indenture, and immediately after which, no event of default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an event of default, shall have occurred and be continuing. An officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel will be delivered to the trustee, which will serve as conclusive evidence of compliance with these provisions.\n\nModification and Waiver\n\nExcept as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the indenture or the debt securities of any series may be amended or supplemented, and waivers may be obtained, with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of the applicable series at the time outstanding (including, without limitation, additional debt securities of such series, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, debt securities of such series), and any existing default or Event of Default (other than a default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium on, if any, or interest on, debt securities of such series, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of such indenture or the applicable debt securities may be waived with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of the applicable series at the time outstanding (including, without limitation, additional debt securities of such series, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such series). Without the consent of each holder of outstanding debt securities affected thereby, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any debt securities held by a non-consenting holder):\n\n \n\n         •                 \nreduce the percentage in principal amount of debt securities, the consent of whose holders is required for any amendment, supplement, or waiver;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nreduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on the debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nreduce the principal or change the stated maturity of any debt securities of any series;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nreduce any premium payable on the redemption of any debt security, change the time at which any debt security may or must be redeemed or alter or waive any of the provisions with respect to the redemption of such debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nmake payments on any debt security payable in currency other than as originally stated in such debt security;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nimpair the holder’s right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on any debt security; or\n\n \n\n         •                 \nwaive a continuing default or event of default regarding any payment on the debt securities.\n\nNotwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of debt securities, we and the trustee may amend or supplement the indenture or the applicable debt securities in certain circumstances, including:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, or inconsistency;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto provide for the assumption of our obligations under the indenture by a successor or transferee upon any merger, consolidation, or asset transfer;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto provide for uncertificated debt securities in addition to or in place of certificated debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto provide any security for or guarantees of the debt securities or for the addition of an additional obligor on the debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto comply with any requirement to effect or maintain the qualification of the indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, if applicable;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto add covenants that would benefit the holders of any outstanding series of debt securities or to surrender any of our rights under the indenture;\n\n \n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n         •                 \nto add additional Events of Default with respect to any series of debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto change or eliminate any of the provisions of the indenture; provided that any such change or elimination shall not become effective with respect to any outstanding debt security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture which is entitled to the benefit of such provision;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto provide for the issuance of and establish forms and terms and conditions of a new series of debt securities;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of debt securities otherwise in accordance with the defeasance provisions of the indenture; provided that any such action does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of outstanding debt securities of such series in any material respect;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto issue additional debt securities of any series; provided that such additional debt securities have the same terms as, and be deemed part of the same series as, the applicable series of debt securities to the extent required under the indenture;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of outstanding debt securities in any material respect; or\n\n \n\n         •                 \nto evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee with respect to the debt securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of the indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trust by more than one trustee.\n\nThe holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of each series then outstanding may on behalf of the holders of all of the debt securities of such series waive any past default with respect to those debt securities, except a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any debt security of such series (provided, that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of each series then outstanding may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration).\n\nA supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant, Event of Default or other provision of the indenture that has been expressly included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of securities, if any, or which modifies the rights of the holders of securities of such series with respect to such covenant, Event of Default or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under the indenture of the holders of securities of any other series that does not have the benefit of such covenant, Event of Default or other provision. It will not be necessary for the consent of the holders to approve the particular form of any proposed supplement, amendment, or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance of it.\n\nInformation Concerning the Trustee\n\nIf an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will be required to use the degree of care and skill of a prudent person in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The trustee will become obligated to exercise any of its powers under the indenture at the request of any of the holders of any debt securities issued under the indenture only after those holders have furnished the trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it.\n\nIf the trustee becomes a creditor of ours, it will be subject to limitations in the indenture on its rights to obtain payment of claims or to realize on certain property received for any such claim, as security or otherwise. The trustee is permitted to engage in other transactions with us. If, however, it acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict, resign, or obtain an order from the SEC permitting it to remain as trustee.\n\nPaying Agent, Registrar, and Transfer Agent\n\nFor any debt securities we issue, we will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”). We, upon written notice to the trustee accompanied by an officers’ certificate, may appoint one or more Paying\n\n \n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\nAgents, other than the trustee, for all or any series of such debt securities. If we fail to appoint or maintain another entity as Paying Agent, the trustee shall act as such. We or any of our subsidiaries, upon notice to the trustee, may act as Paying Agent.\n\nWe will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”). We, upon written notice to the trustee accompanied by an officers’ certificate, may appoint one or more Registrars, other than the trustee, for all or any series of debt securities. If we fail to appoint or maintain another entity as Registrar, the trustee shall act as such. We or any of our subsidiaries, upon notice to the trustee, may act as Registrar.\n\nWe will also maintain one or more transfer agents (each, a “Transfer Agent”). Each Transfer Agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent. We, upon written notice to the trustee accompanied by an officers’ certificate, may appoint one or more Transfer Agents, other than the trustee, for all or any series of debt securities. If we fail to appoint or maintain another entity as Transfer Agent, the trustee shall act as such. We or any of our subsidiaries, upon notice to the trustee, may act as Transfer Agent.\n\nThe Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of debt securities outstanding from time to time, and the Paying Agents will make payments on and facilitate transfer of debt securities on our behalf. We may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or transfer agents without prior notice to the holders of debt securities.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe indenture and any debt securities issued thereunder shall be deemed to be a contract made under the internal laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of laws principles that would require the application of any other law. The indenture is subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act that are required to be part of the indenture and shall, to the extent applicable, be governed by such provisions.\n\nSatisfaction and Discharge of Indenture\n\nThe indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to a series of debt securities when either:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nwe have delivered to the trustee for cancellation all outstanding securities of such series, other than any securities that have been destroyed, lost, or stolen and that have been replaced or paid as provided in the indenture;\n\n \n\n         •                 \nall outstanding securities of such series that have not been delivered to the trustee for cancellation have become due and payable or are by their terms to become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the trustee for the giving of notice of redemption, and we shall have irrevocably deposited with the trustee as trust funds the entire amount, in cash in U.S. dollars or noncallable U.S. governmental obligations, or a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay at maturity or upon redemption all securities of such series, including principal of and any premium and interest due or to become due to such date of maturity or date fixed for redemption, as the case may be; or\n\n \n\n         •                 \nwe have properly fulfilled any other means of satisfaction and discharge that may be set forth in the terms of the securities of such series.\n\nIn each case, we will also pay all other sums payable by us under the indenture with respect to the securities of such series and deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel and an officers’ certificate, each stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge with respect to the securities of such series have been complied with.\n\n \n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\nDefeasance\n\nThe term defeasance means the discharge of some or all of our obligations under the indenture. If we deposit with the trustee funds or U.S. government securities, or a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to make payments on any series of debt securities on the dates those payments are due and payable, then, at our option, either of the following will occur:\n\n \n\n         •                 \nwe will be discharged from our obligations with respect to the debt securities of such series (“legal defeasance”); or\n\n \n\n         •                 \nwe will no longer have any obligation to comply with the restrictive covenants under the indenture, and the related events of default will no longer apply to us (“covenant defeasance”).\n\nIf we defease any series of debt securities, the holders of the defeased debt securities of such series will not be entitled to the benefits of the indenture under which such series was issued, except for our obligation to register the transfer or exchange of the debt securities of such series, replace stolen, lost or mutilated debt securities or maintain paying agencies and hold moneys for payment in trust. In the case of covenant defeasance, our obligation to pay principal, premium, and interest on the debt securities of such series will also survive. We will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance would not cause the holders of the debt securities of such series to recognize income, gain, or loss for federal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service or a change in law to that effect.\n\nSame-Day Settlement and Payment\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement, we expect the debt securities will trade in the same-day funds settlement system of DTC until maturity or until we issue the debt securities in certificated form. DTC will therefore require secondary market trading activity in the debt securities to settle in immediately available funds. We can give no assurance as to the effect, if any, of settlement in immediately available funds on trading activity in the debt securities.\n\nBook-Entry, Delivery, and Form\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities of each series will be issued in the form of one or more global debt securities, in definitive, fully registered form without interest coupons, each of which we refer to as a “global security.” Each such global security will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of a nominee of DTC in New York, New York for the accounts of participants in DTC.\n\nInvestors may hold their interests in a global security directly through DTC if they are DTC participants, or indirectly through organizations that are DTC participants. Except in the limited circumstances described below, holders of debt securities represented by interests in a global security will not be entitled to receive their debt securities in fully registered certificated form.\n\nDTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities of institutions that have accounts with DTC (“participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s book-entry system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n \n\n13\n\nTable of Contents\nOwnership of Beneficial Interests\n\nUpon the issuance of each global security, DTC will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the respective principal amount of the individual beneficial interests represented by the global security to the accounts of participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be limited to participants or persons that may hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be shown on, and the transfer of those ownership interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to participants’ interests) and such participants (with respect to the owners of beneficial interests in the global security other than participants).\n\nSo long as DTC or its nominee is the registered holder and owner of a global security, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole legal owner of the debt security represented by the global security for all purposes under the indenture, the debt securities and applicable law. Except as set forth below, owners of beneficial interests in a global security will not be entitled to receive certificated debt securities and will not be considered to be the owners or holders of any debt securities represented by the global security. We understand that under existing industry practice, in the event an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any actions that DTC, as the holder of the global security, is entitled to take, DTC would authorize the participants to take such action, and that participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through such participants to take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. No beneficial owner of an interest in a global security will be able to transfer such interest except in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures, in addition to those provided for under the indenture. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of others, the ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a global security to pledge that interest to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise to take actions in respect of that interest, may be impaired by the lack of a physical certificate representing that interest.\n\nAll payments on the debt securities represented by a global security registered in the name of and held by DTC or its nominee will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner and holder of the global security.\n\nWe expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest in respect of a global security, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the global security as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the global security held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is now the case with securities held for accounts for customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. These payments, however, will be the responsibility of such participants and indirect participants, and neither we, the trustee nor any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in any global security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and its participants or the relationship between such participants and the owners of beneficial interests in the global security.\n\nUnless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for certificated debt securities, each global security may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds.\n\nWe expect that DTC will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of debt securities only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in a global security are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction.\n\n \n\n \n\n14\n\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we expect that DTC will agree to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in each global security among participants of DTC, DTC is under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of us, the underwriters or the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance or nonperformance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.\n\nThe indenture provides that the global securities will be exchanged for debt securities in certificated form of like tenor and of an equal principal amount, in authorized denominations in the following limited circumstances:\n\n(1) DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository or if DTC ceases to be eligible under the indenture and we do not appoint a successor depository within 90 days; or\n\n(2) we determine that the debt securities will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver to the trustee an order to such effect.\n\nThese certificated debt securities will be registered in such name or names as DTC will instruct the trustee. It is expected that such instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in global securities.\n\nThe information in this section of this prospectus concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we do not take responsibility for this information.\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream\n\nIf the depositary for a global security is DTC, you may hold interests in the global security through Clearstream or Euroclear, in each case, as a participant in DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests, in each case, on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in the names of Euroclear and Clearstream on the books of their respective depositaries, which in turn will hold such interests in customers’ securities in the depositaries’ names on DTC’s books.\n\nPayments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices and other matters relating to the debt securities made through Euroclear or Clearstream must comply with the rules and procedures of those systems. Those systems could change their rules and procedures at any time. We have no control over those systems or their participants, and we take no responsibility for their activities. Transactions between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, on one hand, and other participants in DTC, on the other hand, would also be subject to DTC’s rules and procedures.\n\nInvestors will be able to make and receive through Euroclear and Clearstream payments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices and other transactions involving any securities held through those systems only on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States.\n\nIn addition, because of time-zone differences, U.S. investors who hold their interests in the debt securities through these systems and wish on a particular day, to transfer their interests, or to receive or make a payment or delivery or exercise any other right with respect to their interests, may find that the transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, as applicable. Thus, investors who wish to exercise rights that expire on a particular day may need to act before the expiration date. In addition, investors who hold their interests through both DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream may need to make special arrangements to finance any purchase or sales of their interests between the U.S. and European clearing systems, and those transactions may settle later than transactions within one clearing system.\n\n \n\n15\n\nTable of Contents\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK\n\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AMZN.” All outstanding shares of common stock are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.\n\nThe following description of the terms of our common stock is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), both of which are exhibits to this prospectus.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nThe holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted for action by our stockholders.

A similar standard is applicable in the case of derivative actions and actions brought directly by the corporation, except that indemnification only extends to expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such actions, and the statute requires court approval before there can be any indemnification of expenses if the person seeking indemnification has been found liable to the corporation. In addition, the statute requires indemnification of directors and officers to the extent they have been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defending an action, suit, or proceeding (whether brought by a third party or by or on behalf of the corporation). The statute also permits a corporation to pay expenses of defense in advance of the final disposition of an action, suit, or proceeding upon receipt (in the case of a current director or officer) of an undertaking to repay any amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified. The statute provides that it is not exclusive of other indemnification that may be granted by a corporation’s bylaws, disinterested director vote, stockholder vote, agreement, or otherwise.\n\nSection 10 of Amazon.com, Inc.’s (the “Registrant”) Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) requires indemnification to the full extent permitted under Delaware law as it now exists or may hereafter be amended. Subject to any restrictions imposed by Delaware law, the Bylaws provide a right to indemnification for all expense, liability, and loss (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by any person in connection with any actual or threatened action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative by reason of the fact that such person is or was serving as a director or officer of the Registrant or that, being or having been a director or officer of the Registrant, such person is or was serving at the request of the Registrant as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan. Directors and officers also have the right under\n\n \n\nII-1\n\nTable of Contents\nSection 10 of the Bylaws to be paid expenses incurred in defending any such action, suit, or proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided that any advancement of expenses incurred by an individual in his or her capacity as a director or officer (but not in any other capacity) will be made only upon delivery to the Registrant of an undertaking, by or on behalf of the director or officer, to repay any amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined, by a final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal, that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified for the expenses under Section 10 or otherwise.\n\nDirectors and officers of the Registrant are also entitled to indemnification and advancement under Section 10 of the Bylaws to the extent they serve as a director or officer of a majority-owned subsidiary of the Registrant, or in an executive or management capacity at a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise of which the Registrant or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries is a general partner or has a majority ownership interest.\n\nSection 102(b)(7) of the DGCL permits a corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation that a director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability for (i) any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) payments of unlawful dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions, or (iv) any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.\n\nArticle 10 of the Registrant’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) provides that to the full extent that the DGCL, as it now exists or may hereafter be amended, permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors, a director of the Registrant shall not be liable to the Registrant or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Any amendment to or repeal of such Article 10 shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Registrant for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.\n\nThe Registrant has entered into certain indemnification agreements with its directors. The indemnification agreements provide the Registrant’s directors with further indemnification and advancement of expenses, to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n\nThe foregoing summaries are necessarily subject to the complete text of the statute, the Certificate of Incorporation, and the Bylaws, and the arrangements referred to above and are qualified in their entirety by reference thereto.\n\n \n\nII-2\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 16.        \nExhibits.\n\nSet forth below is a list of exhibits included as part of this Registration Statement.\n\n \n\nExhibit\nNumber                  \nDescription\n\n          \nIncorporation by Reference\n(Where a report or registration statement is\n\nindicated below, that document has been\n\npreviously filed with the SEC and the\n\napplicable exhibit is incorporated by\n\nreference thereto)\n\n  4.1                  Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Amazon.com, Inc.

Filed herewith.\n \n\nII-3\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 17.        \nUndertakings.\n\nThe undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:\n\n(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:\n\n(i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;\n\n(ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in the volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and\n\n(iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;\n\nprovided, however, that paragraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) above do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.\n\n(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\n(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.\n\n(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:\n\n(i) Each prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and\n\n(ii) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the\n\n \n\nII-4\n\nTable of Contents\nregistration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.\n\n(5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned Registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned Registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned Registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:\n\n(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned Registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;\n\n(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned Registrant;\n\n(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned Registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant; and\n\n(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned Registrant to the purchaser.\n\n(6) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the Registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\n(7) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\n\n \n\nII-5\n\nTable of Contents\nSIGNATURES\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the Registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing on Form S-3 and has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Seattle, State of Washington, on February 3, 2023.\n\n \n\nAMAZON.COM, INC.\nBy:                 /s/ Shelley L.

In the short term, we face an uncertain economy, but we remain quite optimistic about the long-term opportunities for Amazon. The vast majority of total market segment share in both Global Retail and IT still reside in physical stores and on-premises datacenters; and as this equation steadily flips, we believe our leading customer experiences in these areas along with the results of our continued hard work and invention to improve every day, will lead to significant growth in the coming years. When you also factor in our investments and innovation in several other broad customer experiences (e.g. streaming entertainment, customer-first healthcare, broadband satellite connectivity for more communities globally), there’s additional reason to feel optimistic about what the future holds.”\n\nHighlights\n\nObsessing over the customer experience\n\nAmazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day.

Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks.

In the short term, we face an uncertain economy, but we remain quite optimistic about the long-term opportunities for Amazon. The vast majority of total market segment share in both Global Retail and IT still reside in physical stores and on-premises datacenters; and as this equation steadily flips, we believe our leading customer experiences in these areas along with the results of our continued hard work and invention to improve every day, will lead to significant growth in the coming years. When you also factor in our investments and innovation in several other broad customer experiences (e.g. streaming entertainment, customer-first healthcare, broadband satellite connectivity for more communities globally), there’s additional reason to feel optimistic about what the future holds.”\n\nHighlights\n\nObsessing over the customer experience\n\nAmazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, in the past quarter, Amazon:\n\nHad a record-breaking holiday season with customers purchasing nearly half a billion items from small businesses in the U.S. During Amazon’s biggest Thanksgiving-through-Cyber-Monday holiday shopping weekend ever, customers around the world purchased hundreds of millions of products, and small businesses in the U.S. generated more than $1 billion in sales over the five-day period.\nMade Same-Day Delivery even faster in major metropolitan areas in the U.S., such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Sacramento, and Portland, Oregon, where customers can now receive hundreds of thousands of items within hours.

In the EU, Same-Day Delivery is now available in Belgium.\nAttracted more than 100 million viewers worldwide to the first season of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, making it the most watched Amazon Original series in every region of the world, with more than 24 billion minutes streamed, and driving more Prime sign-ups worldwide during its launch window than any previous Prime Video content. Amazon Studios also announced the all-female slate of directors—Charlotte Brändström, Sanaa Hamri, and Louise Hooper—for Season Two of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, which is currently in production in the UK.\nFinished the Thursday Night Football (TNF) season with the youngest median age of any NFL broadcast package since 2013 and viewership up 11% from last season among hard-to-reach 18- to 34-year-olds, according to Nielsen Media Research. TNF featured the most streamed NFL games ever, with an average audience of 11.3 million viewers, according to combined data from Amazon’s first-party measurement metrics and Nielsen Media Research. Prime Video also made history as the first streamer to place on Variety’s Top 100 Primetime Telecasts of 2022, with four of its TNF telecasts making the list.\nPremiered several Original series and films, including Western drama The English, with Emily Blunt;family-friendly competition show Dr. Seuss Baking Challenge; My Policeman,starring Harry Styles;and documentary Good Night Oppy. Prime Video also released new seasons of existing series, including the fourth volume of Rihanna’s annual fashion experience Savage X Fenty and the third season of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, starring John Krasinski.

Global business and technology consulting company Slalom will develop vertical solutions and accelerators on AWS for joint customers.\nInventing on behalf of customers\n\nAmazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better in some meaningful way. For example, this past quarter, Amazon:\n\nExpanded Buy with Prime to all eligible U.S. merchants, letting more merchants offer Prime customers fast, free delivery, a seamless checkout experience, and easy returns on their websites.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.\n\nFirst Quarter 2023 Guidance\n\nNet sales are expected to be between $121.0 billion and $126.0 billion, or to grow between 4% and 8% compared with first quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 210 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\nOperating income is expected to be between $0 and $4.0 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in first quarter 2022.\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\n\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.
